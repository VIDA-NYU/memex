			<p class="headingAnchor" id="H1"><span class="h1">INTRODUCTION</span>&#160;&#8212;&#160;The family <em>Filoviridae </em>consists of two genera, the Ebola and Marburg viruses, which are among the most virulent pathogens of humans [<a href="/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/1" class="abstract_t">1</a>]. The Zaire species of Ebola virus, discovered in an outbreak in Zaire (the present Democratic Republic of the Congo) in 1976, is the causative agent of the 2014 epidemic in West Africa, where the case fatality rate is estimated to be as high as70 percent [<a href="/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/2" class="abstract_t">2</a>]; rates in earlier outbreaks reached 80 to 90 percent [<a href="/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/3" class="abstract_t">3</a>]. </p><p>Epidemics of Ebola virus disease are generally thought to begin when an individual becomes infected through contact with the body fluids of an infected animal. Once the individual becomes ill or dies, the virus spreads to others who come into direct contact with their blood or other body fluids. On rare occasions, Ebola virus disease has resulted from accidental laboratory infections, and there is concern that the virus might be used as an agent of bioterrorism.</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Ebola virus disease will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention of this disease are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href="/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease?source=see_link" class="medical medical_review">&quot;Epidemiology and pathogenesis of Ebola virus disease&quot;</a> and <a href="/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-ebola-virus-disease?source=see_link" class="medical medical_review">&quot;Treatment and prevention of Ebola virus disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H134221"><span class="h1">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span>&#160;&#8212;&#160;During the nearly 40 years since the first recognized Ebola outbreaks in Zaire and Sudan in 1976, a number of publications have described the clinical and laboratory features of this disease [<a href="/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/1,4,5" class="abstract_t">1,4,5</a>]. That information is now being supplemented by a rapidly increasing number of case reports and large patient series from the epidemic in West Africa that describe the clinical manifestations and disease course of Ebola virus disease among those in West Africa, as well as those treated in American and European hospitals (<a href="/contents/image?imageKey=ID%2F99186&amp;topicKey=ID%2F3022&amp;source=see_link" class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef99186 ">table 1</a>) [<a href="/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/6-10" class="abstract_t">6-10</a>]. </p><p>Although most features of Ebola virus disease in West Africa match earlier descriptions, two aspects appear to differ: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">&#9679;</span>Hemorrhage is a less common and less clinically important aspect of the syndrome. Thus, the term &quot;Ebola virus disease&quot; is now being used, rather than the earlier name &quot;Ebola hemorrhagic fever.&quot; </p><p/><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">&#9679;</span>Volume losses from vomiting and diarrhea make a greater contribution to severe illness than previously recognized. </p><p/><p class="headingAnchor" id="H134397"><span class="h2">Incubation period</span>&#160;&#8212;&#160;Patients with Ebola virus disease typically have an abrupt onset of symptoms 6 to 12 days after exposure (range 2 to 21 days) [<a href="/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/6,11,12" class="abstract_t">6,11,12</a>]. There is no evidence that asymptomatic persons still in the incubation period are infectious to others. All symptomatic individuals should be assumed to have virus in the blood and other body fluids, and appropriate safety precautions should be taken [<a href="/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/13" class="abstract_t">13</a>]. (See <a href="/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease?source=see_link&amp;anchor=H8#H8" class="medical medical_review">&quot;Epidemiology and pathogenesis of Ebola virus disease&quot;, section on 'Transmission'</a> and <a href="/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-ebola-virus-disease?source=see_link&amp;anchor=H606182952#H606182952" class="medical medical_review">&quot;Treatment and prevention of Ebola virus disease&quot;, section on 'Infection control precautions'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H134474"><span class="h2">Signs and symptoms</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">&#9679;</span><strong>Initial syndrome</strong> &mdash; Most cases of Ebola virus disease begin with the abrupt onset of fever, chills, and general malaise, but low-grade fever and malaise may also precede the development of more severe symptoms [<a href="/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/14" class="abstract_t">14</a>].</p><p/><p class="bulletIndent1">Common signs and symptoms reported from the 2014 West Africa outbreak include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, and loss of appetite [<a href="/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/6,11,15" class="abstract_t">6,11,15</a>]. Reports have also described weakness, myalgias, as well as a high fever accompanied by relative bradycardia as seen in typhoid fever [<a href="/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/5,14" class="abstract_t">5,14</a>].</p><p/><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">&#9679;</span><strong>Rash</strong> &mdash; A diffuse erythematous, nonpruritic maculopapular rash may develop by day five to seven of illness. The rash usually involves the face, neck, trunk, and arms, and can desquamate [<a href="/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/4,5,16-19" class="abstract_t">4,5,16-19</a>]. During the 2014 outbreak in West Africa, rash was reported as rare in Sierra Leone [<a href="/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/6" class="abstract_t">6</a>]; however, it was clearly described in case reports of infected healthcare workers [<a href="/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/10,14" class="abstract_t">10,14</a>]. </p><p/><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">&#9679;</span><strong>Gastrointestinal</strong> &mdash; Gastrointestinal signs and symptoms are common, and usually develop within the first few days of illness. These include watery diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. During the 2014 West African outbreak, vomiting and diarrhea have resulted in severe fluid loss, potentially leading to dehydration, hypotension, and shock [<a href="/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/6-9" class="abstract_t">6-9</a>].</p><p/><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">&#9679;</span><strong>Hemorrhage</strong> &mdash; Despite the traditional name of &quot;Ebola hemorrhagic fever&quot;, major bleeding is not a common finding. Case series from the 2014 outbreak in West Africa indicate that approximately 20 percent of patients have unexplained hemorrhage, most commonly manifested as blood in the stool (about 6 percent), petechiae, ecchymoses, oozing from venipuncture sites, pregnancy related hemorrhage, <span class="nowrap">and/or</span> mucosal hemorrhage [<a href="/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/11,20" class="abstract_t">11,20</a>]. Major bleeding is seen most commonly in the terminal phase of illness.</p><p/><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">&#9679;</span><strong>Neurologic</strong> &mdash; Patients may develop a syndrome suggestive of meningoencephalitis, with findings such as an altered level of consciousness, stiff neck, <span class="nowrap">and/or</span> seizures. These clinical manifestations present later in the course of disease, typically after day 10 [<a href="/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/9" class="abstract_t">9</a>]. </p><p/><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">&#9679;</span><strong>Other findings</strong> &mdash; Patients with Ebola virus disease may also develop hiccups, chest pain, <span class="nowrap">and/or</span> shortness of breath. In addition, conjunctival injection and dark red discoloration of the soft palate are common physical findings [<a href="/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/17" class="abstract_t">17</a>]. Pregnant women may experience spontaneous miscarriages [<a href="/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/20" class="abstract_t">20</a>]. </p><p/><p>Reports of past outbreaks have largely focused on cases of severe and fatal illness, but the spectrum of Ebola virus infection may include milder cases that have escaped detection [<a href="/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/21-23" class="abstract_t">21-23</a>]. A brief report of an outbreak in Gabon from 2000 suggested that some family members of patients developed &quot;asymptomatic&quot; infections after providing care [<a href="/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/22" class="abstract_t">22</a>]. However, this observation is difficult to interpret since the report did not provide a description of physical examination findings, while laboratory data suggested the subjects were undergoing an intense inflammatory response.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
INDIVIDUAL: An individual subscription permits one individual to access
and use the Licensed Materials for his or her own use only by loading
the software on a single computer (i.e., within a single CPU) at a fixed
location, by loading the PDA software on a single Personal Digital
Assistant (PDA), or by using his or her unique user name and password to
access the Licensed Materials from any location via the Internet.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Materials only for a purpose related to your business by loading the
software on a single computer (i.e., within a single CPU) owned or
controlled by you, with a hard drive owned or controlled by you
connected directly to such computer. You may not install the software on
more than one computer. A Standalone Workstation license does not
include Internet access to the Licensed Materials.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

INSTITUTIONAL SUBSCRIPTION: An Institutional Subscription permits only
individuals who are employed by or affiliated with the relevant
institution to access and use the Licensed Materials at any
Internet-connected computer validated for such use by UpToDate, but only
for the clinical, educational or research purposes of the Institution.
Further, access may be restricted to particular websites per the
applicable invoice terms.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
OWNERSHIP: The Licensed Materials, including without limitation all
copyrights and other intellectual property rights therein, are the sole
and exclusive property of UpToDate (or its parents, subsidiaries,
affiliates, or designees) or its suppliers. By indicating that you
accept these terms, you do not become the owner of the Licensed
Materials, but are entitled to use them only according to the terms of
this Agreement.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
PERMITTED USES: You may print out, or email to a colleague, individual
articles containing only insubstantial portions of the most current
version of the Licensed Materials, but only for a) your personal
clinical, educational or research use; b) teaching healthcare
professionals; or c) consulting with individual colleagues, provided
that any printed or emailed articles include a source reference to
UpToDate and its copyright notice. You are not permitted to print or
email substantial portions of the Licensed Materials, nor to email
individual articles to large numbers of recipients.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
PROHIBITED USES: Except as expressly permitted in this Agreement, any
copying, distribution or modification of the Licensed Materials is
strictly prohibited. No part of the Licensed Materials may be copied for
resale or other commercial use, or posted on public bulletin boards, web
sites, Internet domains, or online chatrooms. No part of the Licensed
Materials may be reverse engineered or included in other software.
UpToDate electronically monitors compliance with this Agreement, and
reserves the right in its sole discretion to change and or cancel an
individual's user name and password or to disable an IP address without
notice in the event of multiple concurrent logins, excessive search
quantities or excessive download traffic volumes. You agree to comply
with all applicable laws, including all US export laws and regulations,
in connection with the Licensed Materials.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SUBSCRIPTION TERM: You have obtained the right to use and access the
Licensed Materials for a specific limited period of time, i.e., the
subscription period for which you or your Institution have agreed to pay
subscription fees. At the end of this period, your license and your
associated rights, such as technical support, will expire automatically,
unless you or your Institution have renewed your subscription on
UpToDate's then-current terms. UpToDate may embed technology in the
Licensed Materials causing them to become inaccessible after your
subscription term. The Agreement and your license to use the Licensed
Materials will also terminate if you fail to comply with any term or
condition in this Agreement.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
RESTRICTION AGAINST TRANSFER: You may not sublicense, assign, share,
sell, rent, lease, or otherwise transfer your right to use the Licensed
Materials (including your username and password) whether by merger,
operation of law, or otherwise.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
USE OF PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT: The editors and authors of the Licensed
Materials have conscientiously and carefully tried to create the
identified diagnosis measures, treatment alternatives and drug dosages
in the Licensed Materials that conform to the standards of professional
practice that prevailed at the time of publication. However, standards
and practices in medicine change as new data become available and the
individual medical professional should consult a variety of sources. For
this reason, only the most current release of the Licensed Materials
should be consulted when information is sought. New updates of the
Licensed Materials are issued periodically; do not rely on older
versions. In addition, when prescribing medications, the user is advised
to check the product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify
conditions of use and identify any changes in dosage schedule or
contraindications, particularly if the agent to be administered is new,
infrequently used or has a narrow therapeutic range.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Licensed Materials describe basic principles of diagnosis and
therapy. The information provided in the Licensed Materials is no
substitute for individual patient assessment based upon the healthcare
provider's examination of each patient and consideration of laboratory
data and other factors unique to the patient. The Licensed Materials
should be used as a tool to help the user reach diagnostic and treatment
decisions, bearing in mind that individual and unique circumstances may
lead the user to reach decisions not presented in the Licensed
Materials. The opinions expressed in the Licensed Materials are those of
its authors and editors and may or may not represent the official
position of any medical societies cooperating with, endorsing or
recommending the Licensed Materials.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
LIMITED RIGHTS NOTICE. Any access to the Licensed Materials provided
under contract to the Government are provided with limited rights. The
Licensed Materials may be reproduced and used by the Government with the
express limitation that they will not, without written permission of
UpToDate, be used for purposes of manufacture nor disclosed outside the
Government. The term &quot;Government&quot; as used herein shall have
the meaning ascribed to it in 48 CFR 52.227-14.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
LIMITED WARRANTY: If UpToDate has supplied physical media to you
containing the Licensed Materials and they are defective, such media
will be replaced without charge if returned to the place of purchase
within 60 days after date of payment of the license fee. EXCEPT AS SET
FORTH IN THE FOREGOING SENTENCE, NEITHER UPTODATE NOR ANY OTHER PARTY OR
MEDICAL SOCIETY MAKES ANY WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION, EXPRESSED OR
IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE LICENSED MATERIALS, WHICH ARE LICENSED
&quot;AS IS&quot;. ALL OTHER WARRANTIES ARE EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED AND
DISCLAIMED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTIES
ARISING BY STATUTE OR OTHERWISE IN LAW OR FROM COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE
OF PERFORMANCE, OR USE OF TRADE. ANY STATEMENTS OR REPRESENTATIONS MADE
BY ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY ARE VOID. YOU ASSUME ALL RISK AS TO THE
QUALITY, FUNCTION, PERFORMANCE, AND ACCURACY OF THE LICENSED MATERIALS.</p>

<p>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY: IN NO EVENT WILL UPTODATE OR ANY OTHER
PARTY WHO HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN THE CREATION, PRODUCTION, PROMOTION OR
MARKETING OF THE LICENSED MATERIALS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PARTY
FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, RELIANCE, EXEMPLARY, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOSS OF DATA OR PROFITS, OR FOR
INABILITY TO USE THE LICENSED MATERIALS, EVEN IF UPTODATE OR SUCH OTHER
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT
SHALL UPTODATE OR SUCH OTHER PARTY'S LIABILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES OR LOSS
TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PARTY EXCEED THE LICENSE FEE PAID FOR THE LICENSED
MATERIALS.</p>

<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on how long an
implied warranty lasts and some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion
or limitation of special, indirect, incidental, exemplary, or
consequential damages, or the limitation of liability to specified
amounts, so the above limitation and exclusion may not apply to you if
prohibited by applicable law. You may also have other rights which vary
from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. You agree that this Agreement shall
not be subject to the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
GENERAL: If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid
or unenforceable under any applicable law, it shall be deemed omitted
and the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.
This Agreement may be modified only in writing authorized by UpToDate.
UpToDate's waiver of any right shall not constitute a waiver of that or
any other right in the future. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws and in the state and federal
courts of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, USA. This Agreement
constitutes the entire understanding between the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof, and all prior agreements, representations,
statements, and undertakings, oral or written, are hereby expressly
superseded and canceled. Sections 2 and 4-9 survive in full force and
effect following expiration or termination of this Agreement.</p>
