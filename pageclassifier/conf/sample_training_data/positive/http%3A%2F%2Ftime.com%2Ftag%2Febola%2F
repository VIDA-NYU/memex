	<h2 class="article-excerpt" itemprop="alternativeHeadline">The outbreak has so far claimed 8,795 lives across the affected West African region</h2>
    <p>Scientists at a French research institute say the Ebola virus has <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/health-31019097" target="_blank">mutated</a> and they are studying whether it may have become more contagious.</p>
<p>Researchers at the Institut Pasteur are analyzing hundreds of blood samples from Guinean Ebola patients in an effort to determine if the new variation poses a higher risk of transmission, according to the BBC<em>.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve now seen several cases that don&#8217;t have any symptoms at all, asymptomatic cases,&#8221; said human geneticist Dr. Anavaj Sakuntabhai. &#8220;These people may be the people who can spread the virus better, but we still don&#8217;t know that yet. A virus can change itself to less deadly, but more contagious and that&#8217;s something we are afraid of.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although virus mutations are common, researchers are concerned that Ebola could eventually morph into an airborne disease if given enough time.</p>
<p>However, there is no evidence to suggest this has happened yet, and the virus is still spread only via direct contact with an infected person.</p>
<p>Institut Pasteur, which first pinpointed the current Ebola outbreak last March, is hoping that two vaccines they are developing will reach human trials by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Current figures indicate 8,795 of some 22,000 cases across Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone &mdash; around 40% &mdash; have been fatal.</p>

    <p>Bill Gates, the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft, has <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/world-must-prepare-war-against-global-pandemic-gates-041627810.html;_ylt=AwrTWf0WaMhUnRUA4SfQtDMD" target="_blank">cautioned</a> that a technology-based action plan is needed to guard against future pandemics similar to how we &#8220;prepare ourselves for war.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="cap-annotation cap-annotation_s2s">Gates, whose charitable Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation disburses nearly $4 billion worldwide, urged the international community to apply lessons learned from the Ebola crisis to develop a plan for future outbreaks. One strategy would be to create volunteer teams able to respond quickly to a public health emergency, the Agence-France Presse reported.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A more difficult pathogen [than Ebola] could come along, a form of flu, a form of SARS or some type of virus that we haven&#8217;t seen before,&#8221; Gates told the AFP.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know it will happen but it&#8217;s a high enough chance that one of the lessons of Ebola should be to ask ourselves: are we as ready for that as we should be? A good comparison is that we prepare ourselves for war &mdash; we have planes and training and we practise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gates outlined his fears in a speech in Berlin for the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation<span class="cap-annotation cap-annotation_s2s"> alliance, which delivers vaccines to the Global South.</span> His warning comes on the heels of a World Bank <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-31013636" target="_blank">statement</a> that the globe is &#8220;dangerously unprepared&#8221; for another public health emergency similar to the Ebola outbreak.</p>

<p>There are just over 50 patients currently in MSF&#8217;s Ebola treatment centers across the three countries, the organization announced on Monday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This decline is an opportunity to focus efforts on addressing the serious weaknesses that remain in the response,&rdquo; Brice de la Vingne, MSF director of operations said in a statement. &ldquo;We are on the right track, but reaching zero cases will be difficult unless significant improvements are made in alerting new cases and tracing those who have been in contact with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is still work to do on that score; in Guinea and Liberia only half of the new cases are people who are known contacts of people with Ebola. Since just a single case can spur an outbreak, more contact tracing is needed.</p>

<p class="p1">In Sierra Leone, incidences of Ebola have dropped to their lowest levels since August, though there are still hot zones like the country&#8217;s capital of Freetown. Guinea&#8217;s caseloads are also dropping, but more cases are coming from regions that were previously thought to be leveling out. Liberia has experienced some of the greatest drops out of all three countries. MSF says that on Jan. 17, there were no Ebola cases at the organization&#8217;s ELWA 3 Ebola management center in the capital city of Monrovia, and currently there are only two patients.</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3682680"></div>

    <aside class="right-rail-module rr-outbrain" data-name="rr-outbrain"><div class="OUTBRAIN" data-src="http://time.com/3681696/who-ebola-changes/" data-widget-id="SB_2" data-ob-template="timemag"></div></aside><p>The head of the UN&#8217;s global health agency has laid out a set of reforms to better and more quickly fight disease outbreaks, in a frank acknowledgement that the organization struggled to confront the scale of the 2014 Ebola outbreak that killed more than 8,600 people.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was West Africa&rsquo;s first experience with the virus, and it delivered some horrific shocks and surprises,&#8221; said World Health Organization (WHO) director General Margaret Chan in a speech on Sunday. &#8220;The world, including WHO, was too slow to see what was unfolding before us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The needed changes, she said, include country-specific emergency workforces trained with &#8220;military precision&#8221;; a strengthened team of epidemiologists for detecting disease and a network of other providers to allow responders to reach &#8220;surge capacity.&#8221;</p>
<div class="galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded" data-gallery="3507006" data-size="default"></div>
<p>&#8220;The Ebola outbreak revealed some inadequacies and shortcomings in this organization&rsquo;s administrative, managerial, and technical infrastructures,&#8221; she said, calling for a &#8220;dedicated contingency fund to support rapid responses to outbreaks and emergencies.&#8221;</p>
<p>The remarks came as the WHO&#8217;s executive board prepared to meet in Geneva to discuss reform proposals that many in the international community consider to be overdue. The response to Ebola by the UN&#8217;s health agency was seen by many as slow and ineffectual.</p>
<p>Indeed, Sunday&#8217;s speech did not mark the first time Chan acknowledged her organization&#8217;s shortcomings. In October, she told <a href="http://time.com/3548096/ebola-world-health-organization-margaret-chan/" target="_blank">TIME</a> that &#8220;the scale of the response did not match the scale of the outbreak.&#8221;</p><aside class="right-rail-module rr-ad" data-name="rr-ad"><div class="right-rail-ad" id="right-rail-ad-3681696"></div></aside><aside class="right-rail-module rr-share" data-name="rr-share"><span class="social-links">

	<h2 class="article-excerpt" itemprop="alternativeHeadline">Two vaccines will start trials in February</h2>
    <p>The long-awaited vaccine for Ebola is heading to clinical trials in Liberia.</p>
<p>Two vaccines, with the National Institutes of Health&#8217;s (NIH) support, will start efficacy testing in Liberia in the beginning of February.</p>
<p>The NIH is launching the trial in collaboration with the Liberian Ministry of Health. The trial will test two vaccines against a placebo. People in Liberia who agree to participate in the trial will be split evenly into three groups. Two groups will test separate vaccines and the third group will be given a placebo. The trial will take place in Montserrado County, which includes the capital Monrovia, one of the country&#8217;s hardest-hit regions.</p>

<p>The vaccines have already undergone early safety trials at various sites in the U.S., Europe, and in parts of Africa. &#8220;There were no significant safety concerns and [the vaccine] induced the type of response that was quite comparable to the animal response of the monkeys,&#8221; says Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Prior trials in monkeys had shown the vaccine made the animals immune to the virus.</p>
<p>Initially the target date for the vaccine trial in West Africa had been end of January, but some logistics still need to be worked out. Fauci told TIME that he can say with almost certainty that the trials will indeed launch in early February. &#8220;There are a couple of minor issues that we are just ironing out with regard to the protocol with the FDA,&#8221; says Fauci. &#8220;Nothing that&#8217;s a show stopper.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the two vaccines being tested is a vaccine developed and tested by the NIH and pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), and the other vaccine is coming from biotech company NewLink Genetics and the pharmaceutical company Merck.</p>
<p>When the trial starts, the vaccines will initially be given to 600 people to collect additional data on the vaccine&#8217;s safety. If all goes well, the second part of the trial will launch with 27,000 people.</p>

<p>Liberia, which reported almost 9,000 cases since the deadly outbreak began in 2013, only detected eight new cases last week, reports the BBC. On some days, no new cases materialize at all, a heartening sign in a country where doctors once saw 509 new cases weekly at their peak.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would have identified the turning point as the beginning of the decline, first in Liberia and then later in Sierra Leone and Guinea,&#8221; Dr. Christopher Dye, the director of Ebola strategy for the WHO director general, told the BBC. &#8220;The incidence is pretty clearly going down in all three countries now.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Sierra Leona, where the health crisis once saw 748 cases flooding into hospitals each week, numbers are also stabilizing. The story is similar in Guinea, where the Ebola crisis reached a crescendo at 292 cases per week late last year.</p>
<p>Worldwide, Ebola has killed nearly 8,700 people and infected over 20,000 in one of the largest public health emergencies in recent memory.</p>
<p>Still, health officials at the WHO are exercising caution and warning that Ebola can reappear if risks are not properly mitigated. &#8220;Contact tracing,&#8221; or detecting everyone who ever came into contact with an Ebola-afflicted patient, is crucial to thwart future infection. Even one case cropping up can re-infect seemingly eradicated areas.</p>

    <p>Three priests from a church in Guinea were <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-30900917" target="_blank">physically assaulted</a> while visiting the village of Kabac on Tuesday, as locals suspected they were health workers who would expose inhabitants to the Ebola virus.</p>
<p>The villagers beat up the priests, who had planned to spray insecticide around the area, the BBC reported. They also vandalized the nearby town council building, setting fire to it after burning the priests&#8217; car.</p>
<p>Guinea, one of the three West African countries worst affected by the Ebola outbreak, has lost nearly 2,000 people to the disease. The nation&#8217;s schools reopened earlier this week following a five-month break, soon after the U.N. said the number of cases nationwide had fallen to its lowest weekly total since August.</p>

<p>The country&rsquo;s Health Minister Ousmane Kone made an announcement during a national broadcast on Sunday night.</p>
<p>During his speech, Kone heaped praise on the country&#8217;s health workers and Malian authorities for &#8220;weeks of intense work&#8221; that led to the result, <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/mali-government-un-declare-country-ebola-free-221318115.html">according</a> to Agence France-Presse.</p>
<p>Mali recorded its first Ebola case in October after a 2-year-old <a href="http://time.com/3535363/mali-minister-of-health-confirms-first-ebola-case/">contracted</a> the deadly virus. Following the incident, the country launched a massive eradication campaign.</p>
<p>In total, the disease only infected eight people in the country, but six of them were killed by it, according to statistics compiled by the WHO.</p>
<p>More than 8,400 people have succumbed to the deadly virus in West Africa.</p>

A virus can change itself to less deadly, but more contagious and that&#8217;s something we are afraid of.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Although virus mutations are common, researchers are concerned that Ebola could eventually morph into an airborne disease if given enough time.<\/p>\n<p>However, there is no evidence to suggest this has happened yet, and the virus is still spread only via direct contact with an infected person.<\/p>\n<p>Institut Pasteur, which first pinpointed the current Ebola outbreak last March, is hoping that two vaccines they are developing will reach human trials by the end of

MSF says that on Jan. 17, there were no Ebola cases at the organization&#8217;s ELWA 3 Ebola management center in the capital city of Monrovia, and currently there are only two patients.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3682680\"><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">The latest case numbers from the World Health Organization (WHO) show cases have reached 21,724 with 8,641 deaths.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\t\t\t<form id=\"wpcom-iframe-form-40bd30ac347dee4d0f4e23c8bb376284-54cc19a360ed7\" target=\"wpcom-iframe-40bd30ac347dee4d0f4e23c8bb376284-54cc19a360ed7\" method=\"post\" action=\"\/\/wpcomwidgets.com\/?wpcom_origin=https%3A%2F%2Ftimedotcom.wordpress.com\" style=\"display: none\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"frameborder\" value=\"0\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"scrolling\" value=\"no\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"resize\" value=\"0\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"replace_attributes\" value=\"1\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"fallback\" value=\"&lt;p class=&quot;protected-embed-fallback&quot;&gt;This embed is invalid&lt;\/p&gt;\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"class\" value=\"\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"width\" value=\"100%\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"height\" value=\"650\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_data\" value=\"PGlmcmFtZSBzcmM9J2h0dHA6Ly9jZG4ua25pZ2h0bGFiLmNvbS9saWJzL3RpbWVsaW5lL2xhdGVzdC9lbWJlZC9pbmRleC5odG1sP3NvdXJjZT0wQXA2VzlUUXNzVEtwZEZJelNWbE9lRlZYV205VFQybDZhbU15YTBGR1ZGRSZmb250PUJldmFuLVBvdGFub1NhbnMmbWFwdHlwZT10b25lciZsYW5nPWVuJmhlaWdodD02NTAnIHdpZHRoPScxMDAlJScgaGVpZ2h0PSc2NTAnIGZyYW1lYm9yZGVyPScwJz48L2lmcmFtZT4=,d3b8444151fb7c8f793860e394946dac9f4319fa\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_tag\" value=\"protected-iframe\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_hash\" value=\"40bd30ac347dee4d0f4e23c8bb376284\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/form>\n\t\t\t<iframe name=\"wpcom-iframe-40bd30ac347dee4d0f4e23c8bb376284-54cc19a360ed7\" id=\"wpcom-iframe-40bd30ac347dee4d0f4e23c8bb376284-54cc19a360ed7\" width=\"100%\" height=\"650\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"  class=\"wpcom-protected-iframe \"><\/iframe>\n\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t( function() {\n\t\t\tvar func = function() {\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe_form = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-form-40bd30ac347dee4d0f4e23c8bb376284-54cc19a360ed7');\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-40bd30ac347dee4d0f4e23c8bb376284-54cc19a360ed7');\n\t\t\t\tif ( iframe_form && iframe ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe_form.submit();\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe.onload = function() {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.contentWindow.postMessage( {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'msg_type': 'poll_size',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'frame_id': 'wpcom-iframe-40bd30ac347dee4d0f4e23c8bb376284-54cc19a360ed7'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}, window.location.protocol + '\/\/wpcomwidgets.com' );\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t\/\/ Autosize iframe\n\t\t\t\tvar funcSizeResponse = function( e ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tvar origin = document.createElement( 'a' );\n\t\t\t\t\torigin.href = e.origin;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\/\/ Verify message origin\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'wpcomwidgets.com' !== origin.host )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\/\/ Verify message is in a format we expect\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'object' !== typeof e.data || undefined === e.data.msg_type )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\tswitch ( e.data.msg_type ) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcase 'poll_size:response':\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById( e.data._request.frame_id );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.width )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.width = '100%';\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.height )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.height = parseInt( e.data.height );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefault:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\tif ( 'function' === typeof window.addEventListener ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.addEventListener( 'message', funcSizeResponse, false );\n\t\t\t\t} else if ( 'function' === typeof window.attachEvent ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.attachEvent( 'onmessage', funcSizeResponse );\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tif (document.readyState === 'complete') { func.apply();

Prior trials in monkeys had shown the vaccine made the animals immune to the virus.<\/p>\n<p>Initially the target date for the vaccine trial in West Africa had been end of January, but some logistics still need to be worked out. Fauci told TIME that he can say with almost certainty that the trials will indeed launch in early February. &#8220;There are a couple of minor issues that we are just ironing out with regard to the protocol with the FDA,&#8221; says Fauci. &#8220;Nothing that&#8217;s a show stopper.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>One of the two vaccines being tested is a vaccine developed and tested by the NIH and pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), and the other vaccine is coming from biotech company NewLink Genetics and the pharmaceutical company Merck.<\/p>\n<p>When the trial starts, the vaccines will initially be given to 600 people to collect additional data on the vaccine&#8217;s safety.

Sengema, Sierra Leone.<br><br><\/b>\"The rain started shortly after a small team of Red Cross burial workers approached the body. The deceased man, reportedly in his mid-sixties, collapsed and died outside his remote home more than a day before the burial team arrived. Having received instructions from officials that bodies of Ebola victims are extremely contagious, his family members placed a sheet over his body, marked a cordon in the sand, and called the Red Cross. With approximately 20 burial workers serving all of Kailahun district, an area the size of Rhode Island and rife with Ebola, the team had a backlog of cases.<br><br> His family endured the presence of his body, laying prone and exposed to the elements, for more than 24 hours. As the team removed the sheet, the stench of death filled the air. The white cloth around the man\u2019s head was crimson with blood. As burial workers sprayed him with chlorine, family members erupted with emotion. I was moved imagining how I might respond if I were in the situation. To me, this picture represents the range of Ebola\u2019s emotional impact. In the two women, we see the devastation and loss that the virus causes. In the faces of the men, we see a sense of despondence, disbelief and suspicion that also defines the response.

The tragic irony is that no one dared try to help for fear of contracting the Ebola virus from his blood and bodily fluids, as avoiding contact is one of the measures of preventing the disease from spreading.","width":2560,"height":1707,"orientation":"square","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3507162\/inside-ebola-crisis-moving-photographs\/photo\/ebola-in-liberia-14\/","encoded_url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3507162\/inside-ebola-crisis-moving-photographs\/photo\/ebola-in-liberia-14\/","twitter_via":"TIMEHealth","encoded_title":"Inside+the+Ebola+Crisis%3A+The+Images+that+Moved+them+Most","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3507162%2Finside-ebola-crisis-moving-photographs%2Fphoto%2Febola-in-liberia-14%2F","email_title":"Inside%20the%20Ebola%20Crisis%3A%20The%20Images%20that%20Moved%20them%20Most","twitter_text":"See%20inside%20the%20Ebola%20crisis%3A%20the%20images%20that%20moved%20them%20most","fb_text":"See%20inside%20the%20Ebola%20crisis%3A%20the%20images%20that%20moved%20them%20most","email_body":"Inside%20the%20Ebola%20Crisis%3A%20The%20Images%20that%20Moved%20them%20Most%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3507162%2Finside-ebola-crisis-moving-photographs%2Fphoto%2Febola-in-liberia-14%2F","src":{"small":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/10\/ahmed-jallanzo-epa.jpg?w=405","small_2x":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/10\/ahmed-jallanzo-epa.jpg?w=810","large":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/10\/ahmed-jallanzo-epa.jpg?w=405","large_2x":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/10\/ahmed-jallanzo-epa.jpg?w=838","fullscreen_fhd":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/10\/ahmed-jallanzo-epa.jpg?w=1620","fullscreen_qhd":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/10\/ahmed-jallanzo-epa.jpg?w=2160"}},{"id":3507197,"title":"tommy-trenchard","slug":"tommy-trenchard","caption":"<b>Tommy Trenchard, Aug. 20, 2014.

Ebola didn't kill him, but the fear, panic and confusion it creates led to the circumstances in which he died. He is a symbol of what Ebola can do to a country or a community. The quarantine of West Point was heavily criticized and lifted shortly afterwards. It achieved little, and Ebola remains rife throughout the city. It is also telling that he died of a treatable wound. After health staff started getting ill and hospitals became seen as sites of infection, the whole health system collapsed.

On some days, no new cases materialize at all, a heartening sign in a country where doctors once saw 509 new cases weekly at their peak.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I would have identified the turning point as the beginning of the decline, first in Liberia and then later in Sierra Leone and Guinea,&#8221; Dr. Christopher Dye, the director of Ebola strategy for the WHO director general, told the BBC. &#8220;The incidence is pretty clearly going down in all three countries now.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In Sierra Leona, where the health crisis once saw 748 cases flooding into hospitals each week, numbers are also stabilizing. The story is similar in Guinea, where the Ebola crisis reached a crescendo at 292 cases per week late last year.<\/p>\n<p>Worldwide, Ebola has killed nearly 8,700 people and infected over 20,000 in one of the largest public health emergencies in recent memory.<\/p>\n<p>Still, health officials at the WHO are exercising caution and warning that Ebola can reappear if risks are not properly mitigated. &#8220;Contact tracing,&#8221; or detecting everyone who ever came into contact with an Ebola-afflicted patient, is crucial to thwart future infection. Even one case cropping up can re-infect seemingly eradicated areas.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-pos=\"6\" data-continuous=\"1\"><object id=\"bc-video-3933472253001-6\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/ti.me\/1CHPkrl\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"3933472253001\"><\/object><\/div>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3679701\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=The%20Ebola%20Fight%20Has%20Reached%20a%20%E2%80%98Turning%20Point%E2%80%99%20in%20West%20Africa%2C%20the%20WHO%20Says%20%7C%20TIME&body=The%20Ebola%20Fight%20Has%20Reached%20a%20%E2%80%98Turning%20Point%E2%80%99%20in%20West%20Africa%2C%20the%20WHO%20Says%0A%0ABut%20the%20World%20Health%20Organization%20says%20vigilance%20is%20imperative%20to%20prevent%20reinfection%20in%20seemingly%20eradicated%20areas%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3679701%2Febola-who-turning-point-liberia-guinea-sierra-leone%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3679701%2Febola-who-turning-point-liberia-guinea-sierra-leone%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1CHPkrl&text=Number%20of%20cases%20falling%20in%20Ebola-stricken%20countries&via=TIMEHealth\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3679701%2Febola-who-turning-point-liberia-guinea-sierra-leone%2F&title=The+Ebola+Fight+Has+Reached+a+%E2%80%98Turning+Point%E2%80%99+in+West+Africa%2C+the+WHO+Says\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment livefyre-commentcount toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3679701\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3679701\/ebola-who-turning-point-liberia-guinea-sierra-leone\/\" data-title=\"The Ebola Fight Has Reached a &amp;#8216;Turning Point&amp;#8217;
