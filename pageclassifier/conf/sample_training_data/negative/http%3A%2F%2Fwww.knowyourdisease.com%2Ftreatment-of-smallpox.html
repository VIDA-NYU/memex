                                <p><span class="style13">Definition </span><span class="style12"><strong>:</strong> </span><br />
                                Smallpox is a contagious, disfiguring and often deadly disease caused by the   variola virus. It's believed to have first appeared in northeastern Africa or   south-central Asia nearly 12,000 years ago. Since then, few other illnesses have   had such a profound effect on human health and history. In the 20th century   alone, an estimated 300 million people died of smallpox.</p>
                                <p>The initial signs and symptoms of smallpox, which appear about two weeks   after infection, resemble those of the flu: fever, fatigue and headache. Later,   severe pus-filled blisters appear on the skin that eventually leave deep, pitted   scars. Once symptoms develop, there's no effective treatment for smallpox and no   known cure.</p>
                                <p>Naturally occurring smallpox was finally eradicated worldwide in the 1970s &mdash;   the result of an unprecedented immunization campaign. But the virus didn't   disappear entirely. Stocks of smallpox virus, set aside for research purposes,   are officially stored in two high-security labs &mdash; one in the United States and   one in Siberia. This has lead to concerns that smallpox someday may be used as a   biological warfare agent.</p>
                                <span class="style13">Causes:</span><br />
                                The variola virus causes smallpox. Under high magnification, variola   particles look like rectangles with a deeply patterned surface. They're   sometimes referred to as bricks. Each brick is composed of at least a hundred   different proteins. Although extraordinarily large for a virus, 3 million   smallpox bricks lined end to end would be no larger than the period at the end   of a sentence.
                                <p>Once you're infected, the virus immediately begins replicating inside your   cells &mdash; first in the lymph nodes and then in your spleen and bone marrow.   Eventually, the virus settles in the blood vessels in your skin and the mucous   membranes of your nose and throat. When the lesions in your mouth slough off,   large amounts of virus are released into your saliva. This is when you're most   likely to transmit the disease to others.</p>
                                <p><strong>How smallpox spreads</strong><br />
                                  Smallpox usually requires   face-to-face contact to spread. It's most often transmitted in air droplets when   an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. Inhaling a single particle may be   enough to cause infection. In rare instances, airborne particles may spread   through the ventilation system in a building, infecting people in other rooms or   on other floors. Smallpox also can spread through contact with contaminated   clothing and bedding, although the risk of infection from these sources is   slight.</p>
                                <p>Smallpox outbreaks typically occur in two-week intervals. Initially, just a   few people get sick. Fourteen days later, a larger number of people develop the   disease, and in another two weeks, even more cases appear. This pattern reflects   the incubation period of the virus as well as its exponential spread.</p>
                                <p><strong>Types of smallpox</strong><br />
                                  Two main forms of smallpox exist :</p>
                                <ul>
                                  <li><strong>Variola minor.</strong> This is a milder form of   the disease and causes a less serious illness. It's fatal in less than 1 percent   of people who contract it. </li>
                                  <li><strong>Variola major.</strong> By contrast, this form of   the disease kills one-third of the people it infects. </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>There are also two rare forms of smallpox :</p>
                                <ul>
                                  <li><strong>Hemorrhagic smallpox.</strong> This form is   characterized by a red, pinpoint rash and bleeding in the skin and mucous   membranes. In some cases, hemorrhagic smallpox may destroy the entire skin   surface and all mucous membranes. Hemorrhagic smallpox is almost always fatal   within five to seven days. </li>
                                  <li><strong>Malignant smallpox.</strong> This form is also   often fatal. The early signs and symptoms are similar to other forms of the   disease, but the lesions are velvety and never become filled with pus.   Eventually, the skin takes on a rubbery appearance. Bleeding in the skin and   intestinal tract also may occur. </li>
                                </ul>
                                <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
                                  <tr>
                                    <td width="70%" align="left" valign="top"><span class="style13">Symptoms </span><span class="style12"><strong>:</strong></span><br />
                                      The first symptoms of smallpox usually appear 12 to14 days after you're   infected. During the incubation period of seven to 17 days, you look and feel   healthy and can't infect others.
                                      <p>Following the incubation period, a sudden onset of flu-like signs and   symptoms occurs. These include :</p>
                                      <ul>
                                        <li>Fever </li>
                                        <li>A feeling of bodily discomfort (malaise) </li>
                                        <li>Headache </li>
                                        <li>Severe fatigue (prostration) </li>
                                        <li>Severe back pain</li>
                                    </ul>                                    </td>
                                    <td width="30%" align="right" valign="top"><table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#CCCCCC">

                                        <td><img src="images/smallpox.gif" width="150" height="95" /></td>

                                  <tr>
                                    <td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p>A few days later, the characteristic smallpox rash appears as flat, red spots   (lesions). Within a day or two, many of these lesions turn into small blisters   filled with clear fluid (vesicles) and later, with pus (pustules). The rash   appears first on your face, hands and forearms and later on the trunk. It's   usually most noticeable on the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet.   Lesions also develop in the mucous membranes of your nose and mouth. The way the   lesions are distributed is a hallmark of smallpox and a primary way of   diagnosing the disease.</p>
                                      <p>When the pustules erupt, the skin doesn't break, but actually separates from   its underlying layers. The pain can be excruciating. Scabs begin to form eight   to nine days later and eventually fall off, leaving deep, pitted scars. All   lesions in a given area progress at the same rate through these stages. People   who don't recover usually die during the second week of illness.</p>
                                      <p><strong>Smallpox vs. chickenpox</strong><br />
                                        In the past, smallpox was   sometimes confused with chickenpox, a childhood infection that's seldom deadly.   Yet chickenpox differs from smallpox in several important ways :</p>
                                      <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Severity and location of lesions.</strong> Chickenpox lesions are much more superficial than are those of smallpox and   occur primarily on the trunk, rather than on the face, arms and hands. </li>
                                             <li><strong>Severity and location of lesions.</strong> Chickenpox lesions are much more superficial than are those of smallpox and   occur primarily on the trunk, rather than on the <li><strong>Types of lesions.</strong> You'll often see a   combination of scabs, vesicles and pustules in someone with chickenpox. In   smallpox, all of the lesions in a given area are at the same stage. </li>
                                        <li><strong>Timing of transmission.</strong> A person infected   with chickenpox can unknowingly transmit the virus to others before symptoms   ever develop. But smallpox becomes infectious only when signs and symptoms   appear and remains contagious until scabs fall from the pustules. According to   the World Health Organization (WHO), smallpox is most contagious after the fever   starts and during the first week of the rash. You're less likely to become   infected if you're exposed to someone in the later stages of the disease. </li>
                                    </ul></td>
                                  </tr>
                                </table>    
                                <p><span class="style13">Diagnosis:</strong></span><br />
                                Trained health workers can diagnose smallpox without the need for laboratory   tests. The World Health Organization provides training materials to help health   staff recognize smallpox and distinguish it from chickenpox. Still, an initial   case of smallpox is likely to be confirmed by laboratory testing.</p>
                                <p>Even a single confirmed case of smallpox would be considered an international   health emergency to be reported immediately to local health authorities and   national officials.</p>
                                <p><span class="style13">Complications :</strong></span><br />
                                Historically, variola major is fatal in about 30 percent of people who   contract it. Almost no one survives the hemorrhagic and malignant forms of the   disease. People who recover from smallpox usually have severe scars, especially   on the face, arms and legs. In many cases, smallpox may lead to blindness.</p>
                                <p><span class="style13"><strong>Treatment:</strong></span><br />
                                No cure for smallpox exists. There is some evidence that cidofovir &mdash; an   antiviral medication normally used to treat an infection known as   cytomegalovirus (CMV) &mdash; might prevent smallpox if it's administered within a day   or two of exposure. The smallpox vaccine itself can prevent or lessen the   severity of the disease if given within four days of infection. But neither of   these is useful once signs and symptoms develop, and both can have serious side   effects. For now, the best that doctors can offer people with symptomatic   smallpox is supportive therapy and antibiotics to prevent secondary   infections.</p>
                                <p>Apart from immediate vaccination, isolation is the only way to manage the   disease. Unfortunately, isolation can only contain the spread of the virus, not   eradicate it.</p>
                                <p>If an outbreak of smallpox were to occur, people with confirmed cases of the   disease would be treated in separate hospitals, in other special facilities or   at home. Those admitted to regular hospitals would probably be placed in   negative pressure rooms &mdash; the pressure outside the room is greater than the   pressure inside &mdash; with highly sophisticated air filtration systems. Strict   precautions would be taken with bed linen and clothing. Even so, the risk is so   high that all hospital employees as well as most other patients would probably   be vaccinated against the disease.</p>
                                <p><span class="style13"><strong>Prevention:</strong></span><br />
                                Smallpox is one of the most devastating of human diseases. In its 12,000-year   history, it has probably killed more people than any other illness, including   the plague. Yet no naturally occurring smallpox cases have been reported for   nearly 25 years. The story of smallpox prevention, and its eventual eradication   through immunization, is a long and compelling one.</p>
                                <p><strong>Smallpox vaccine</strong><br />
                                  For centuries, it was known that people   who survived smallpox became immune to it. For that reason, nearly every   civilization tried to induce immunity in healthy individuals. The Chinese used   tubes to insert powdered smallpox scabs into their nostrils. In Turkey, pus from   lesions was scratched into the skin.</p>
                                <p>Eventually these methods &mdash; collectively known as variolation &mdash; reached Europe   and the New World. There, as elsewhere, variolation had varying degrees of   success. Some people became immune, but others contracted the disease and died   or became the source of a new epidemic. Still, by the early 1700s,   &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; smallpox inoculation had become widespread.</p>
                                <p>In 1788, the scientist Edward Jenner inoculated a healthy, 8-year-old boy   with cowpox &mdash; a disease caused by a virus that closely resembles variola.   Cowpox's natural hosts are small mammals such as wood mice, but the virus can   spread to other animals, especially cattle, and lesions on the udders and teats   of cows can infect people who milk them. Although rare today, cowpox was   widespread in 18th-century Europe, where it was common knowledge that milkmaids   who virus can   spread to other animals, especially cattle, and lesions on the udders and teathad been infected with cowpox &mdash; which is generally mild &mdash; were then immune   to the far more deadly smallpox.</p>
                                <p>Jenner's experiment was a success. His patient failed to contract smallpox,   even when deliberately exposed to variola. By 1800, cowpox vaccinations (the   word &quot;vaccine&quot; is from the Latin word for &quot;cow&quot;) were commonplace, primarily   because they caused fewer side effects and deaths than did variolation with   smallpox itself.</p>
                                <p>Smallpox vaccine that was used in the United States until vaccinations were   stopped contained live vaccinia virus &mdash; a virus similar to cowpox and closely   related to variola. Before 1972, most young children were vaccinated against   smallpox, as were military recruits and many people traveling out of the   country.</p>
                                <p>In 1967, the World Health Organization launched a global immunization   campaign to eradicate smallpox. At that time, 2 million to 3 million people died   of smallpox every year. The WHO's efforts were remarkably effective, and the   last naturally occurring case of smallpox was reported in 1977. In 1980,   smallpox vaccinations were discontinued worldwide.</p>
                                <p><strong>The vaccine today</strong><br />
                                  The United States currently has enough   smallpox vaccine to vaccinate all Americans. In September 2002, the Centers for   Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released to health officials in all the   states a contingency plan to quickly inoculate every American should the need   arise.</p>
                                <p>Such a decision would not be undertaken lightly because the smallpox vaccine   also has the small but real potential to cause serious harm. Experts in virology   say the vaccinia vaccine causes a fatal complication in about one of every 1   million people who receive it. That means that if the entire American population   were to be vaccinated, 300 people would be expected to die of complications from   the vaccine. Another 3,000 or so might develop painful sores and severe scars,   while 600 others would likely have residual brain damage from encephalitis &mdash; a   potentially fatal brain inflammation.</p>
                                <p>Evidence from the vaccination of some military personnel and health care   professionals also suggests that the smallpox vaccine may cause inflammation of   the heart (myocarditis), inflammation of the membrane covering the heart   (pericarditis), or a combination of these two conditions (myopericarditis).   Heart pain (angina) and heart attacks also have been reported in a small number   of people who have been vaccinated, although it's not entirely clear whether the   vaccine caused these conditions.</p>
                                <p><strong>Who should not receive the vaccination</strong><br />
                                  Because of the   risk of severe and sometimes fatal reactions, the CDC and WHO recommend that the   general public not be vaccinated. But because military personnel and some health   care workers continue to be vaccinated, it's important to know who should not   receive the vaccine.</p>
                                <p>You should not receive the smallpox vaccine if you :</p>
                                <ul>
                                  <li><strong>Have certain skin conditions.</strong> This   includes eczema, a history of eczema or other chronic skin conditions, or   sharing a household with someone with eczema, a history of eczema or skin   conditions such as impetigo. </li>
                                  <li><strong>Are pregnant.</strong> The vaccinia vaccine is not   known to cause birth defects, but in rare cases it may cause infection of the   fetus, leading to stillbirth or death soon after delivery. </li>
                                  <li><strong>Have impaired immunity.</strong> You shouldn't   have a vaccination if you have a disease or undergoing treatment that suppresses   your imme   fetus, leading to stillbirth or death soon after delivery. </li>
                                  <li><strong>Have impaired immunity.</strong> You shouldn't   have a vaccination if you have une system. This includes people with cancer, people with organ   transplants, and those undergoing radiation therapy or treatment with drugs that   suppress the immune system. </li>
                                  <li><strong>Have AIDS or are HIV-positive.</strong> The human   immunodeficiency virus (HIV) wasn't identified before the end of routine   smallpox vaccination, so it's not known what effect vaccinia might have on   people with the disease. Currently, the CDC recommends that HIV-positive people   not receive the vaccine. </li>
                                  <li><strong>Are allergic to any of the ingredients in the   vaccine.</strong> This includes the antibiotics polymyxin B sulfate,   streptomycin sulfate, chlortetracycline hydrochloride and neomycin sulfate.   Vaccinia vaccine does not contain penicillin. </li>
                                  <li><strong>Have underlying heart disease.</strong> You also   shouldn't be vaccinated if you have three or more known risk factors for heart   disease, including high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, smoking, or   a parent or sibling with heart disease. </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>If you were vaccinated before 1972</strong><br />
                                About 40 percent of   Americans have never been vaccinated against smallpox. Others received the   vaccine 25 years ago or more. It's not known how long immunity lasts, although   it's likely the vaccine is most effective for about five to 10 years. Partial   immunity may last much longer. In addition, people who are revaccinated appear   to have increased immunity.</p></td>
