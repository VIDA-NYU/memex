		<div class="video-content"><p>After 42 Floridians came down with dangerous mosquito-borne diseases, state officials <a href="Sooner%20or%20later,%20our%20mosquitoes%20will%20pick%20it%20up%20and%20transmit%20it%20to%20us.%20That%20is%20the%20imminent%20threat,%2522%20he%20added." target="_blank">advised</a> citizens on Wednesday to take steps to protect themselves against bug bites.</p>
<p>The Florida Department of Health announced 24 confirmed cases of <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/dengue/" target="_blank">dengue</a> fever as of last week, and 18 confirmed cases of <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/" target="_blank">chikungunya</a>, both viruses that do not have vaccines to prevent them and have not typically been found in North America, the CDC says.</p>
<p>All Floridians infected had traveled to the Caribbean or South America, and officials believe they may have contracted the diseases there, but epidemiologists worry that Florida mosquitos may be spreading the illnesses, which could lead to a potential outbreak, Reuters reports.</p>
<p>Dengue is a potentially fatal disease and both can cause long-term problems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The threat is greater than I&rsquo;ve seen in my lifetime,&rdquo; said Walter Tabachnick, director of the Florida Medical Entomological Laboratory in Vero Beach. &#8220;Sooner or later, our mosquitoes will pick it up and transmit it to us. That is the imminent threat,&#8221; he said.</p>

Google has its own low-tech VR device called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/get\/cardboard\/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Cardboard<\/a> that could help YouTube&rsquo;s 360-degree videos spring to life.<\/p>\n<p>[<a href=\"http:\/\/gizmodo.com\/youtube-will-soon-support-360-degree-video-uploads-1677627074\"><i>Gizmodo<\/i><\/a>]<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=This%20Is%20the%20Craziest%20New%20Feature%20YouTube%20Has%20Added%20in%20Years%20%7C%20TIME&body=This%20Is%20the%20Craziest%20New%20Feature%20YouTube%20Has%20Added%20in%20Years%0A%0AA%20totally%20new%20way%20to%20watch%20stuff%20may%20be%20on%20its%20way%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3656474%2Fyoutube-360-degree-videos%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3656474%2Fyoutube-360-degree-videos%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1Kj3ULq&text=YouTube%20will%20add%20360-degree%20videos%20in%20the%20coming%20weeks&via=Techland\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3656474%2Fyoutube-360-degree-videos%2F&title=This+Is+the+Craziest+New+Feature+YouTube+Has+Added+in+Years\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment livefyre-commentcount toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3656474\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3656474\/youtube-360-degree-videos\/\" data-title=\"This Is the Craziest New Feature YouTube Has Added in Years\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Tech","slug":"tech","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tech\/","description":"Technology news, reviews, how-to's and analysis of smartphones, tablets, computers, apps, video games, streaming media, innovation, social networks and more","tech":true},"tag":{"name":"Media","slug":"media","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/media\/"},"tags":"360 video|360-degree video|Media|online video|Virtual Reality|YouTube","hero":{"class":"landscape","mini":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/12\/gangnam-style-youtube-psy.jpg?w=74&h=74&crop=1","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/12\/gangnam-style-youtube-psy.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/12\/gangnam-style-youtube-psy.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/12\/gangnam-style-youtube-psy.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/12\/gangnam-style-youtube-psy.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/12\/gangnam-style-youtube-psy.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Kim Jae-Hwan\u2014AFP\/Getty Images","caption":"South Korean singer Park Jae-Sang, also known as Psy, sp\/gangnam-style-youtube-psy.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.fileeaks during a press conference after returning from a US trip, in Seoul on September 25, 2012.

Michael Capuano, who voted for &#8220;Nancy D&rsquo;ALESSANDRO Pelosi&#8221; in a shout, and Florida Rep. Ted Yoho&mdash;&#8221;YOHO!&#8221;&mdash;who voted for himself. Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Georgia Rep. John Lewis, who were sitting an aisle apart, shared a bewildered glance and a smile when Arizona Rep. Kyrsten Sinema cast a vote for Lewis. Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert gave off an excellent &ldquo;why not&rdquo; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nationaljournal.com\/congress\/rep-louie-gohmert-s-perfect-response-to-voting-for-himself-for-speaker-20150106\">shrug<\/a> when he voted for himself for Speaker.<\/p>\n<p>There were several unexpected votes, including ones for former Secretary of State Colin Powell, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions. First-year members who campaigned against the Washington establishment like Virginia Republican Rep. Dave Brat, who beat former Majority Leader Eric Cantor in his primary, and Florida Democrat Gwen Graham voted against their party leaders and for South Carolina Rep. Jeff Duncan and Tennessee Rep. Jim Cooper, respectively. The majority of the anti-Boehner conservatives votes went to Republican Rep. Dan Webster, a little-known member outside of Florida where he has served as the state&rsquo;s House speaker and Senate Majority Leader, who garnered 12 votes. The opposition to Boehner proved to be loud enough to hear but not strong enough to really matter.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3656401\"><\/div>\n<p>Kansas Rep. Tim Huelskamp, a frequent critic of Boehner, voted for Webster but said he didn&rsquo;t ask anyone to oppose the Speaker.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;There is a lot of power in that office; I know some folks feel a lot of pressure and feel like they are being intimidated,&rdquo; said Huelskamp, who criticized the way the congressional leadership brought to the floor the end of the year government spending bill. &ldquo;And that is part of the problem. Speaker Boehner promised an open process and that hasn&rsquo;t happened. As we saw in the CROmnibus&mdash;a 1,600 page bill thrown down and we had less than two days to read it and no chance to allow amendments&mdash;that is exactly what he told us he would change about the previous Speaker.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The vast majority of Republicans and Democrats voted for their party&#8217;s leader; 216 cast votes for Boehner and 164 for Pelosi out of 408 total votes. Texas Rep. Pete Sessions, who supported Boehner and chairs the Rules Committee, said that he was excited for the new session but recognized the concerns of vocal conservatives who voted against Boehner.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wake up call for everybody,&rdquo; said Sessions. &ldquo;We need to be aware that we got to do a better job to effectively communicate what we stand for and why we&rsquo;re here. When you take $200 million away from the IRS because you&rsquo;ve been trying to do that for four years, and people don&rsquo;t respect that even though they had asked for it, then there&rsquo;s a problem.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Go and set some new expectations of what to call a victory,&rdquo; he added.<\/p>\n<p>In his speech after the vote, Boehner asked the House to &ldquo;stand tall and prove the skeptics wrong.&rdquo;<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3656401\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Boehner%20Re-Elected%20House%20Speaker%20%7C%20TIME&body=Boehner%20Re-Elected%20House%20Speaker%0A%0A%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3656401%2Fboehner-speaker-reelected%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3656401%2Fboehner-speaker-reelected%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1wStfl5&text=Boehner%20re-elected%20speaker%20of%20the%20House&via=TIMEPolitics\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3656401%2Fboehner-speaker-reelected%2F&title=Boehner+Re-Elected+House+Speaker\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment livefyre-commentcount toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3656401\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3656401\/boehner-speaker-reelected\/\" data-title=\"Boehner Re-Elected House Speaker\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

The U.N. said the secretary-general would review the paperwork.<\/p>\n<p>In a statement posted on the U.N.&#8217;s treaty website, the secretary-general announced his acceptance of the documents saying &#8220;the statute will enter into force for the State of Palestine on April 1, 2015&#8243; in accordance with the court&#8217;s procedures. He said he was &#8220;acting in his capacity as depositary&#8221; for the documents of ratification.<\/p>\n<p>Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas signed documents to join the ICC a day after the U.N. Security Council rejected a resolution on Dec. 30 that would have set a three-year deadline for the establishment of a Palestinian state on lands occupied by Israel.<\/p>\n<p>Joining the ICC is part of a broader Palestinian strategy to pressure Israel into withdrawing from the territories and agreeing to Palestinian statehood. Abbas has been under heavy domestic pressure to take stronger action against Israel after a 50-day war between the Jewish state and militants in Gaza over the summer, tensions over holy sites in Jerusalem, and the failure of the last round of U.S.-led peace talks.<\/p>\n<p>The Palestinian decision to join the ICC has already sparked retaliation from Israel which froze the transfer of more than $100 million in tax funds collected for the Palestinians on Saturday. It promised tougher action on Sunday.<\/p>\n<p>The United States also opposed the move, calling it an obstacle to reaching a permanent peace agreementl that would give the Palestinians an independent state. The Obama administration said Monday it was reviewing its annual $440 million aid package to the Palestinians because of the decision to join the ICC.<\/p>\n<p>While Palestinian membership in the ICC doesn&#8217;t automatically incur U.S. punishment, any Palestinian case against Israel at the court would trigger an immediate cutoff of U.S. financial support under American law.<\/p>\n<p>Palestinian Ambassador Riyad Mansour said last week that the Palestinians are seeking to raise alleged crimes committed by Israel, including during last summer&#8217;s war in Gaza. He said the Palestinians will also seek justice for Israeli settlements on Palestinian territory, which he said constitute &#8220;a war crime&#8221; under the Rome statute.<\/p>\n<p>The ICC said the Palestinians submitted a document to the court&#8217;s registrar, Herman von Hebel, in The Hague, Netherlands on Jan. 1 stating that Palestine accepts the jurisdiction of the ICC starting June 13 &mdash; about a month before the Gaza war started.<\/p>\n<p>The International Criminal Court was created to prosecute individual perpetrators of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. Palestine will become the 123rd member.<\/p>\n<p>But in Monday&#8217;s press release, the court stressed that accepting the jurisdiction of the ICC &#8220;does not automatically trigger an investigation.&#8221; ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda must determine whether the criteria under the statute for opening an investigation have been met, it said.<\/p>\n<p>The secretary-general also approved Palestinian documents joining 16 other international treaties, conventions and agreements on Tuesday night.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3657153\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=U.N.%20Chief%20Says%20Palestine%20Will%20Join%20International%20Court%20on%20April%201%20%7C%20TIME&body=U.N.%20Chief%20Says%20Palestine%20Will%20Join%20International%20Court%20on%20April%201%0A%0AJoining%20the%20ICC%20is%20part%20of%20a%20broader%20Palestinian%20strategy%20to%20pressure%20Israel%20into%20withdrawing%20from%20the%20territories%20and%20agreeing%20to%20Palestinian%20statehood%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3657153%2Fun-palestine-icc-ban-ki-moon-israel-abbas%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3657153%2Fun-palestine-icc-ban-ki-moon-israel-abbas%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1Kkrwzi&text=U.N.%20chief%20says%20Palestine%20will%20join%20International%20Criminal%20Court%20on%20April%201&via=TIMEWorld\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3657153%2Fun-palestine-icc-ban-ki-moon-israel-abbas%2F&title=U.N.+Chief+Says+Palestine+Will+Join   <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3657153%2Fun-palestin+International+Court+on+April+1\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment livefyre-commentcount toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3657153\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3657153\/un-palestine-icc-ban-ki-moon-israel-abbas\/\" data-title=\"U.N.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they weren&#8217;t authorized to brief journalists.<\/p>\n<p>At the scene of the blast, the dead and wounded lay on a sidewalk against a wall. Water sprayed by firefighters to extinguish the blaze mixed with their pooled blood. A police officer&#8217;s certificate sat in it, soaked crimson. A charred taxi cab smoked near what remained of the minibus, meters (yards) from a gate for the police academy.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;What happened is we were all gathering and &#8230; (the bomber) exploded right next to all of the police college classmates,&#8221; eyewitness Jamil al-Khaleedi told The Associated Press. &#8220;It went off among all of them, and they flew through the air.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. Yemen&#8217;s local al-Qaida branch, targeted in frequent U.S. drone strikes in the country, has carried out similar attacks in the past. Washington considers al-Qaida in Yemen to be the world&#8217;s most dangerous branch of the terror network as it has been linked to several failed attacks on the U.S. homeland.<\/p>\n<p>The blast comes as Shiite rebels known as Houthis seized large areas of Yemen, including Sanaa, earlier this year as part of a protracted power struggle with President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi. Their critics view them as a proxy for Shiite Iran, charges the rebels deny. Al-Qaida militants have targeted the rebels in bombings in the past.<\/p>\n<p>An al-Qaida suicide bomber killed at least 24 peoplstruggle with President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi. Their critics view them as a proxy for Shiite Irae on Dec. 31 in an attack on Houthis as they commemorated the birth of the Prophet Muhammad.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\"

data-ob-template=\"timemag\"><\/div><\/aside><p>Randy Johnson, Pedro Martinez, John Smoltz and Craig Biggio were elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame on Tuesday.<\/p>\n<p>Johnson, nicknamed The Big Unit for his towering 6-foot-10 frame, was one of the most feared pitchers in the game during his prime. His dominant fastball and filthy slider guided him to five Cy Young awards, including four in a row from 1999 to 2002. In 2001, Johnson shared World Series MVP honors with Curt Schilling in the Arizona <a href=\"http:\/\/www.si.com\/mlb\/team\/arizona-diamondbacks\">Diamondbacks<\/a>&#8216; seven-game series win over the New York <a href=\"http:\/\/www.si.com\/mlb\/team\/new-york-yankees\">Yankees<\/a>. Johnson played for six teams in his career before retiring after the 2009 season.<\/p>\n<p>Joining Johnson is Martinez, an eight-time All-Star and three-time Cy Young winner. He played an integral part of the 2004 Boston <a href=\"http:\/\/www.si.com\/mlb\/team\/boston-red-sox\">Red Sox<\/a> team that won the franchise&rsquo;s first World Series in 86 years. His <a href=\"http:\/\/www.si.com\/vault\/2000\/03\/27\/8115790\/the-power-of-pedro-godlike-in-the-eyes-of-heartened-red-sox-fans-pedro-martinez-uses-an-astonishing-mastery-of-four-pitches-and-a-ferocious-will-to-win--not-to-mention-that-smile--to-fuel-bostons-fever-for-a-world-series-title\" target=\"_blank\">1999 season with Boston<\/a> remains one of the greatest pitching seasons in modern baseball history. Martinez finished 23-4 with a 2.07 ERA and 313 strikeouts, en route to a unanimous Cy Young and a second-place finish in MVP voting. He retired after the 2009 World Series, in which he pitched for the Philadelphia <a href=\"http:\/\/www.si.com\/mlb\/team\/philadelphia-phillies\">Phillies<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Rounding out the trio of power pitchers in the 2015 class is Smoltz, the longtime Atlanta Braves pitcher who was at separate times in his career among the game&rsquo;s best starting pitchers and closers. Smoltz started regularly through 1999, helping the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.si.com\/mlb\/team\/atlanta-braves\">Braves<\/a> to a World Series win in &rsquo;95 and earning a Cy Young in 1996. After Tommy John surgery, Smoltz became a full-time closer in 2002 and promptly recorded 55 saves, a then-National League record. He returned to Atlanta&rsquo;s starting rotation in 2005. He retired after 2009 with more than 3,000 strikeouts, 200 wins and 150 saves.<\/p>\n<p>Biggio enters the Hall of Fame in his third year on the ballot. He spent his entire 20-year career with the Houston <a href=\"http:\/\/www.si.com\/mlb\/team\/houston-astros\">Astros<\/a>, playing catcher, second base and outfield. He became the 27th player in MLB history to join the 3,000-hit club in 2007, and the first in Astros history. He&rsquo;s the only player in baseball history with 3,000 hits, 600 doubles, 400 stolen bases and 250 home runs. He also retired with 285 hit-by-pitches, the most in MLB history.<\/p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.si.com\/mlb\/2015\/01\/06\/baseball-hall-fame-class-2015-randy-johnson-pedro-martinez-john-smoltz-craig-biggio\" target=\"_blank\">This article originally appeared on SI.com<\/a><\/em><\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3656315\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Here%E2%80%99s%20the%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20Class%20of%202015%20%7C%20TIME&body=Here%E2%80%99s%20the%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20Class%20of%202015%0A%0AFour%20players%20enter%20the%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20this%20year%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3656315%2F2015-baseball-hall-of-fame%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3656315%2F2015-baseball-hall-of-fame%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F17gpEbU&text=Here%27s%20the%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20class%20of%202015&via=TIME\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3656315%2F2015-baseball-hall-of-fame%2F&title=Here%E2%80%99s+the+Baseball+Hall+of+Fame+Class+of+2015\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment livefyre-commentcount toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3656315\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3656315\/2015-baseball-hall-of-fame\/\" data-title=\"Here&amp;#8217;s the Baseball Hall of Fame Class of 2015\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Sports","slug":"sports","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/sports\/","description":"Where sports is on the mind.

the 55-year-old has struggled to rebuild a life upended by corrupt officials who tried to extort Ostreicher and had him imprisoned without charge while bleeding the rice venture dry.<\/p>\n<p>The ordeal shredded the Brooklyn man&#8217;s marriage, drained his bank account and nearly stole his sanity.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Certain days I don&#8217;t function,&#8221; Ostreicher told The Associated Press in a series of phone conversations, his first media interview since his rescue. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to start a new life.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The former flooring business owner lives alone in Los Angeles and says he&#8217;s still trying to find a new line of work. He says he is not living off charity, never has, but has gotten huge emotional support from family, the Jewish community and a few of Hollywood&#8217;s biggest stars.<\/p>\n<p>None have done more than Penn.<\/p>\n<p>In late 2012, the Oscar-winning actor flew to Bolivia to investigate Ostreicher&#8217;s case at the urging of actor Mark Wahlberg.<\/p>\n<p>Ostreicher, who is an Orthodox Jew, had the attention of the Aleph Institute, a foundation that helps incarcerated Jews. The Florida-based group asked Wahlberg to reach out to Penn, who is widely known for his Haiti relief efforts and closeness to leftist Latin American leaders.<\/p>\n<p>Penn became convinced Ostreicher had been unjustly imprisoned since mid-2011 so corrupt authorities could drain the assets of the $25 million rice-farming operation in which he was a minor investor. Though he was accused of money-laundering, no evidence was ever presented.<\/p>\n<p>Penn was self-effacing when asked about his odd-couple friendship with Ostreicher and why he decided to help. &#8220;What can I say? He was likable,&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>When Penn asked Bolivian President Evo Morales to intercede, Penn got a tepid response.<\/p>\n<p>So he exposed the extortion ring, sparking a scandal that eventually would see 14 Bolivian officials jailed &mdash; the ring&#8217;s No. 2 figure entered a guilty plea last week &mdash; while others fled the country.<\/p>\n<p>Penn then got Ostreicher moved to a medical clinic. The New Yorker had withered to 107 pounds from a liquids-only hunger strike to protest his imprisonment. Penn leveraged his Venezuelan connections &mdash; he was close to the late President Hugo Chavez &mdash; to get armed Venezuelan security guards assigned to protect him, fearing he&#8217;d be targeted for exposing the extortion ring.<\/p>\n<p>Even though he had endured more than 30 court hearings, Ostreicher continued to insist he wanted to clear his name in Bolivia.<\/p>\n<p>Penn told him to let it go.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;He held me down with both hands and looked at me and said, &#8216;I am going to get you home,'&#8221; Ostreicher recalled.<\/p>\n<p>But all Penn could accomplish was to get Ostreicher&#8217;s confinement in the maximum-security prison exchanged for house arrest.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3657160\"><\/div>\n<p>Then, in late 2013, Ostreicher arrived from South America on a commercial flight from Peru to Los Angeles International Airport, where Penn was waiting in the jetway to receive him.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;He is fully responsible, Sean, for saving my life,&#8221; Ostreicher said. &#8220;He is much more than a friend.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Neither Penn nor Ostreicher would discuss the secretive escape in any detail, although Ostreicher said his older brother, Aron, paid for it and that he endured a nerve-wracking flight to La Paz from the eastern city of Santa Cruz sitting near Bolivia&#8217;s chief of police praying he wouldn&#8217;t be recognized. He said he wore a disguise.<\/p>\n<p>Bolivia claimed the escape was orchestrated by the CIA, which Ostreicher denies. He would say only that it involved &#8220;professionals&#8221; whom he declined to identify.<\/p>\n<p>During his years in Bolivia, Ostreicher&#8217;s marriage fell apart, with his wife staying in New York. Penn took him in and, for a few weeks, Ostreicher said, he did little more than stay rolled up in a fetal position on the couch.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I literally was crying to Sean that I want to go back to Bolivia,&#8221; he told the AP.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Sean sat with me for hours, sometimes sitting with me all night, rubbing my back,&#8221; he would later recount at a dinner honoring Penn.<\/p>\n<p>The actor enlisted his own family and friends in the healing.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I told Sean I&#8217;d like to find a person who had it all and lost it all to give me a reason that I should wake up every morning,&#8221; said Ostreicher.<\/p>\n<p>Penn introduced him to Robert Downey Jr.<\/p>\n<p>Downey, who hit bottom in the 1990s when drug addiction troubles landed him in jail for a year, counseled Ostreicher, then sent him clothing &#8220;literally in the tens of thousands of dollars&#8221; &mdash; Gucci suits, sweaters, sneakers, underwear, a Harry Winston watch.<\/p>\n<p>Penn, meanwhile, was at Ostreicher&#8217;s side for some of his most trying moments.<\/p>\n<p>When his daughter, Gitty, flew with her husband and their five children from New Jersey for a February reunion, Ostreicher was terrified, he said.<\/p>\n<p>He tried to find excuses to avoid the meeting, telling Penn he didn&#8217;t have the proper clothing.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I need a white shirt. I need a black suit. I need a certain hat. And Sean jumped into his car and brought me back six hats.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;He said, &#8216;One of them has got to be the right one.'&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>When they arrived for the reunion, the kids didn&#8217;t want to come to him.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t recognize me, the old, sick man I became,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>He began telling the kids about the &#8220;very strong man&#8221; who sneaked him out of Bolivia. &#8220;You want to meet this man?&#8221; Ostreicher asked. Then, he pointed to Penn.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I told Sean, &#8216;Show the kids your biceps.'&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Sean literally went down on his knees, unbuttoned his shirt and flexed his muscles for my grandchildren so they should come closer to me. And this is how they started coming to me.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Asked about the incident, Penn paused briefly.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Jacob has a way,&#8221; he said, &#8220;of putting someone on the spot.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>___<\/p>\n<p>Associated Press writer Carlos Valdez in La Paz, Bolivia, contributed to this report.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div

I would be hard-breathing after that,&rdquo; <a href=\"http:\/\/nesn.com\/2015\/01\/pedro-martinez-reveals-hitter-he-most-hated-to-face-during-career\/\">said<\/a> Martinez during an interview with former Boston Red Sox teammate Kevin Millar on the MLB Network. &ldquo;Edgar was a guy who had the ability to foul off pitches, and it pissed me off when I had to throw 13 pitches to get a guy out.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The Hall of Famer&#8217;s admission came as a bit of surprise to baseball insiders, considering Edgar earned only three hits during his 33 career plate appearances against Pedro.<\/p>\n<p>Martinez was one of four former players, including two other pitchers, to be elected to the vaunted the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York on Tuesday.<\/p>\n<p>[<em><a href=\"http:\/\/nesn.com\/2015\/01\/pedro-martinez-reveals-hitter-he-most-hated-to-face-during-career\/\">NESN<\/a><\/em>]<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Pedro%20Martinez%20Names%20the%20Hitter%20Who%20Gave%20Him%20The%20Hardest%20Time%20%7C%20TIME&body=Pedro%20Martinez%20Names%20the%20Hitter%20Who%20Gave%20Him%20The%20Hardest%20Time%0A%0A%22It%20pissed%20me%20off%20when%20I%20had%20to%20throw%2013%20pitches%20to%20get%20a%20guy%20out%E2%80%9D%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3657135%2Fpedro-martinez-baseball-mlb-hall-of-fame-edgar-martinez%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3657135%2Fpedro-martinez-baseball-mlb-hall-of-fame-edgar-martinez%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1xQqY0P&text=Pedro%20Martinez%20names%20the%20hitter%20who%20gave%20him%20the%20hardest%20time&via=TIME\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3657135%2Fpedro-martinez-baseball-mlb-hall-of-fame-edgar-martinez%2F&title=Pedro+Martinez+Names+the+Hitter+Who+Gave+Him+The+Hardest+Time\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment livefyre-commentcount toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3657135\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3657135\/pedro-martinez-baseball-mlb-hall-of-fame-edgar-martinez\/\" data-title=\"Pedro Martinez Names the Hitter Who Gave Him The Hardest Time\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Sports","slug":"sports","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/sports\/","description":"Where sports is on the mind.
