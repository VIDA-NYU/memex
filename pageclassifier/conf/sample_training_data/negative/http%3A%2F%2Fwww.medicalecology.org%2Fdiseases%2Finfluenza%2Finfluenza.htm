                    <p align="justify">Influenza is a major cause of sickness and death around the world and is one of the most important infectious diseases confronting the world today. Combined with pneumonia, influenza is one of the ten leading causes of death in the United States. Even though most of its victims are elderly, pneumonia-influenza is one of the top-ten leading infectious conditions listed as causing years of potential life lost by the Centers for Disease Control. These facts, plus the memory of the great pandemic of 1918-1919, which killed about 550,000 people in the United States and claimed over 20 million lives around the world, have encouraged much research on this viral infection. The origins of virulent strains and the behavior of epidemics are still not well understood, however, and the unpredictability of emergence of new strains influenza proteins presents serious problems for public health-based control programs throughout the world.
                    <p align="justify">One major complication to controlling the disehowever, and the unpredictability of emergence of new strains influenza proteins presents serious problems for public health-based control programs thase is the fact that flu, during the early phase of the infection, is often confused with the common cold. Influenza is a respiratory infection characterized by headaches, fevers, and short dry coughs. Usually, the disease lasts for up to a week, but infection is especially dangerous for the very young and the elderly, as well as those with certain chronic health problems. The elderly tend to have an overall lower resistance in general, and thus are more susceptible to influenza and its complications. Occasionally, there is a neuro-psychological complication known as &#8220;post-flu depression&#8221; that can last for several weeks or even months.

                    <p align="justify">Influenza was discovered not by a direct study of the disease in humans, but rather from studies on animal diseases. In 1918, J.S. Koen, a veterinarian, observed a disease in pigs which was believed to be the same disease as the now famous &#8220;Spanish&#8221; influenza pandemic of 1918. </p>
                    <p align="justify">In 1928, N. McBryde attempted to transmit influenza from pig to pig by taking mucus from the respiratory tract of sick pigs and instilling it into the noses of healthy pigs. However, this effort failed to transmit the disease because they inoculated only filtered material. Most types of bacterial filters used during that time were unable to allow the flow of viral particles through them.</p>
                    <p align="justify">During the same year, Robert Shope, working at the Rockefeller Institute for Comparative Pathology in Princeton, New Jersey, repeated the same experiments inoculating unfiltered material, instead. Shope was not only able to reproduce the disease, but more importantly, he went on to demonstrate that pigs can also become ill when filtered fluid was used for inoculation. The disease produced by the filtrate was mild and could be transferred repeatedly in pigs. This was the first reliable experimental evidence that influenza was caused by a virus, anat pigs can also become ill when filtered fluid was used for inoculation. The disease produced by the filtrate was mild and could be transferred repead it also provided the basis for further research into the human form of the disease.</p>

                    <p align="justify">People have suffered from influenza for thousands of years. Viruses identical or closely related to the human form of the infection can be isolated from ducks, turkeys, swine, horses, and many other species of warm-blooded vertebrates, as well. It is hypothesized that humans probably acquired influenza when domestication of animals first began. The development of agriculture and the establishment of permanent settlements provided sufficient numbers of potential hosts to create an epidemic. The term &#8220;influenza&#8221; was coined by an Italian in the mid-1700&#8217;s to conote a disease resulting from miasma (bad air). The human disease is thought to have arisen about 6000 years agicient numbers of potential hosts to create an epidemic. The term &#8220;influenza&#8221; was coined by an Italian in the mid-1700&#8217;s to conote ao. A human influenza virus was not isolated until 1933. Wilson Smith, Christopher Andrews, and Patrick Laidrow first identified the virus that causes human influenza only because they found a suitable host for propagation. Laidrow used ferrets in his studies on canine distemper virus, and was able to propagate the flu virus in that same host, as well. Influenza virus was later shown to also infect adult mice and chicken embryos.</p>

During the summer of 1580, influenza was reported in Asia Minor and Northern Africa. Italian accounts suggest that it spread from Malta to Sicily in July 1580 and subsequently diffused north through the Italian peninsula as caused by the influenza virus. During the summer of 1580, influenza was reported in Asia Minor and Northern Africa. Italian accounts suggest that iby August. During that time, Phillip II ruled the Iberian Peninsula, Southern Italy, and several North African ports. The early July outbreak in the Spanish Netherlands was most likely caused by troops sent by Phillip II to fight the Dutch.</p>

                    <p align="justify">  The medical profession of the eighteenth century was ill equipped to deal with influenza at any level. For most doctors, especially in the first six or seven decades of the century, influenza seemed to be spread or &quot;created&quot; by atmospheric factors. Such theories were complex. They usually invoked an unknown poison carried in the air and/or specific winds, temperature changes, barometric pressures, or other meteorological factors to explain the appearance and spread of endemic diseases like inctors. Such theories were complex. They usually invoked an unknown poison carried in the air and/or specific winds, temperature changes, barometric prfluenza. To that extent, most eighteenth and early nineteenth-century articles on influenza are much more likely to contain elaborate meteorological tables than geographical reconstructions or statistics on morbidity or mortality. Influenza pandemics occurred at least three times in the eighteenth century: 1729-1730, 1732-1733, and 1781-1782. In addition there were two major epidemics that could possibly be considered pandemics, in 1761-1762 and 1788-1789. Of these, two warrent further discussion: the pandemic of 1729-1730 and the great pandemic of 1781-1782.</p>
                    <p align="justify">The 1729-1730 pandemic was the first recorded pandemic, most likely fostered by the age of discovery. Flu apparently did not break out in North America until October 1732, when the disease was widespread along the New England coast from Boston to southern Maine. Although the origins and termination of the 1729-1730 outbreak are unclear, it obviously was a pandemic, the first of a series that western European observers perceived as coming from Russia. An origin in Russia seems plausible, but there is no documentation of this. Initial reports were of substantial outbreaks in two widely separated Russian cities, Moscow and Astrakhan, on the Caspian Sea, in April, 1729. There were no further reports during the summer, but influenza prevailed in Sweden in September ation of this. Initial reports were of substantial outbreaks in two widely separated Russian cities, Moscow and Astrakhan, on the Caspian Sea, in Apriand in Vienna in October. During November, flu was prevalent in Hungary and Poland, swept deep into Germany and appeared in London, Plymouth, York and Durham England, as well in Dublin, Ireland. </p>
                    <p align="justify">While quantitative evidence is lacking, the 1729-1730 pandemic caused sickness but relatively few deaths. Morbidity was extensive, but mortality was generally low, although the case-fatality rate was considered serious in northern Italy. Persons of all ages were stricken, but deaths were most numerous among the elderly and pregnant women. </p>

Unlike other pandemics of the eighteenth century, the pandemic of 1781-1782 had some interesting features that can be compared to the epidemics of the 20th century. A few general characteristics of this pandemic were noticed.</p>

                    <p align="justify">The influenza pandemic of 1918, also known as &#8220;Spanish&#8221; flu, killed more rapidly than any other form of influenza known up to that time. This particular strain of influenza was especially dangerous to young adults. The National Office of Vital Statistics in the United States recorded the distribution of deaths during 1917 showing that the highest levels of morbidity occurred at the extremes of infancy and old age, and was very low in between these two age groups. By 1918, monal Office of Vital Statistics in the United States recorded the distribution of deaths during 1917 showing that the highest levels of morbidity occuorbidity changed dramatically, and was now highest for the very young, and higher yet for persons between the ages of twenty and forty. The elderly appeared to be spared, for the most part. Thus, the Spanish Flu had two outstanding characteristics: 1) it killed millions of people and 2) most of them were in the prime of their life.</p>
                    <p align="justify">This distinctive strain of influenza swept across the face of the earth in three major waves between 1918 and 1919. Although it is uncertain as to where the first wave in the spring of 1918 originated, all available evidence indicates that it appeared in the United States in March of 1918. It attracted very little attention because pneumonic complications were few and deaths even fewer; it appeared as no more than just another bout with the kind of respiratory disease that so often circulates during that time of the year. Only later, after the second and third killer waves appeared did statisticians notice that an unusually large proportion of the flu and pneumonia victims were young adults.</p>
                    <p align="justify">The second wave occurred during March and April and expanded across North America, temporarily disrupting the operation of some military camps and a few factories. It was during this wave that the disease spread throughout most of the rest of the world. Accorsecond wave occurred during March and April and expanded across North America, temporarily disrupting the operation of some military camps and a few fding to records, the disease reached epidemic proportions in Europe in April. It swept across the continent in the spring and summer, and the number of casualties was devastating. In Switzerland alone during the month of July, 53,000 people succumbed to the Spanish Flu.</p>
                    <p align="justify">In late August, the severity of the infection changed, suddenly transforming into the most dangerous strain (or strains) ever recorded. It occurred in three major parts of the North Atlantic almost simultaneously: Freetown. Sierra Leone, where local West Africans were brought together with British, South African, East African, and Australian soldiers and sailors; Brest, France, which was the chief port for Allied troops; and Boston, Massachusetts, one of America&#8217;s busiest embarkation ports and a major crossroads for military and civilian personnel of every nation involved with the Allied war effort. Massive troop movements and the disruption of significant segments of the population during World War I played an important role in the transmission of the disease. </p>

After several months of investigation, most epidemiologists agreed that a strain of influenza virus had surfaced in China early in 1957. Meanwhile, the disease was spreading outward from Southeast Asia.</p>
                    <p align="justify">The new strain of influenza, initially referred to as &#8220;Asian Flu&#8221; had rapidly spread from Hong Kong to Japan, the Philippines, Malaya, and Indonesia by the end of May 1957. By June, there were numerous reports of influenza among passengers and crew on board ships that had departed from East Asian ports. During June, the disease also spread though India and the Middle East. Port cities were among the first places to be affected. Given the nature of international trade, the disease rapidly spread towards England, and reached the United States. </p>

                    <p align="justify">The details surrounding the swine-influenza &quot;outbreak&quot; of 1976 is notable because the event lead to a major change in public health policy. While the exact origins and validity of the Swine Flu outbreak are unknown, many public health and medical researchers believed that the type of swine influenza that was recovered from human victims during the January 1976 outbreak at Fort Dix, New Jersey was so closely related to the influenza strain that caused more than 500,000 deaths in health and medical researchers believed that the type of swine influenza that was recovered from human victims during the January 1976 outbreak at Fo the United States during the 1918-19 pandemic that to ignore the possibility of a repeat of that epidemic seemed irresponsible.</p>
                    <p align="justify">As the result, a nationwide inoculation program was instituted. However, the establishment of such a program was not easy to implement. In spite of identification of swine flu the proposal for a nationwide inoculation program gained little support at the federal level during April and May of that year. Although President Gerald Ford espoused the need for such a program, there was a consensus among many Congressmen that such a program was not warranted. The vaccine program did not officially begin until October. As history would show, the predicted epidemic failed to materialize. However, millions became vaccinated, some with devastaing health consequences. Guillian-Barre Syndrom, a decending paralysis, was not one of the predicted outcomes, yet occurred with a high degree of frequency at the height of the vaccination program. The vaccine was produced by Merck, Inc., but the insurance policy agaist such an eventuality was underwritten by the United States govenment. The public ended up paying out millions of dollars in health care benefits to affected individuals.</p>

                    <p align="justify">Influenza has presented humankind with a moving target since its appearance on the planet, but remakably, the clinical aspects have remained fairly constant. A given human influenza virus can evolve rapidly by one of two mechanisms: 1) antigenic shift (genetic reassortment between a human and a non-human virus in a non-human host), and 2) antigenic drift (accumulation of mutations that facilitate evasion of the host immune response). New influenza viruses constantly emerge from the environment, emanating from such disparate sources as man and a non-human virus in a non-human host), and 2) antigenic drift (accumulation of mutations that facilitate evasion of the host immune response)migratory waterfowl, swine, domestic poultry, and sea mammals. </p>
                    <p align="justify">Reassortment of viral genomes within these animals is the genetic equivalent to recombination in eukaryotic cells, and is an important mechanism of antigenic variation. A pair of viral genes code for two surface glycoproteins, haemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N), the crucial antigens against which the host develops immunological defenses. Thirteen H and nine N subtypes have so far been discovered, many of which occur only in various species of birds, particularly waterfowl. Types H1, H2, H3, N1, and N2 have been positively linked to epidemics in man. </p>
                    <p align="justify">Between major epidemics, mutations produce minor but cumulative antigenic variants in a wide number of animal reservoirs. Major new viral subtypes have appeared in 1918, 1957, and 1968, in each case resulting in a pandemic. The term &#8220;pandemic&#8221; literally means a worldwide epidemic, but for influenza there is also the assumption that a major subtype involving new H and/or N antigens has appeared. These shifts are much more dramatic than the normal slow genetic drift of other subtypes. As a result there is no opportunity for people to develop immunity to the new virus thus allowing the virus to spread faster. </p>
                    <p align="justifese shifts are much more dramatic than the normal slow genetic drift of other subtypes. As a result there is no opportunity for people to develop immuy">Potentially pandemic strains probably arise from recombination with viruses from animal reservoirs. A wide range of virus subtypes have been discovered in wild and domesticated animals, most notably in pigs, horses, turkeys, and ducks. Feral and domesticated ducks harbor an enormous array of antigenic types and may play a major role in the ecology of the influenza A virus. In this century there have been four major shifts: 1918 (Hsw1N1=H1N1, 1957 (H2N2), 1968 (H3N2) and a very puzzling reappearance of a 1950 strain of H1N1, which began to circulate in 1977. There is some evidence that only a limited number of antigenic types recirculate over time in human populations.</p>
                    <p align="justify">Influenza viruses are unique in their ability to cause both recurrent annual epidemics and more serious pandemics that spread rapidly and may affect all or most age groups. The size of epidemics and pandemics are a direct result of antigenic variation of the virus, the amount of protective immunity in populations, and the relative virulence of the viruses.<br>

                    <p align="justify">All organisms whose cells contain a nucleus in their cells, together with many bacteria and viruses, base their reproduction on a DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) genome. However, the influenza virus is among a minority of organisms that base their replication on RNA. The properties of RNA help to explain the epidemiology of influenza and the difficulty of achieving successful prophylactic treatment by using vaccines. </p>
                    <p align="justify">DNA and RNA genomes both use polymerase enzymes for replication, but under suitable conditions, RNA molecules can replicate spontaneously and maintain continuous synthesis. Between the two types of genome, DNA and RNA, RNA viruses have the ability to evolve a million times more rapidly than their DNA based host. Because the error rate of RNA is so high, many variants of an RNA virus may coexist and compete. The fittest of these variants and hence the best adapted to its host will become the most abundant within a given population.</p>

The fittest of these variants and hence the best adapted to its host will become the most arthomyxovirus, measuring 80 to 120 nanometers in diameter. The core of the viral particle consists of ribonucleoproteins surrounded by a lipid envelope that contains two types of glycoproteins in the form of spikes. The haemagglutinin spikes are responsible for binding the virus to red blood cells and other host cells, as well. The second protein, neuraminidase is an enzyme that cleaves terminal sialic acid residues from host-membrane bound glycoproteins and glycolipids. The neuraminidase facilitates release of viral progeny from infected cells as well as the spread of the virus from one cell to another. While antibodies against both haemagglutinin and neuraminidase may reduce the reproduction of the virus in the host, only the antibodies against the haemagglutinin can neutralize the infectivity of the virus particle. There are three strains of flu virus, A, B, and C, each characterized by the antigenic properties of its internal, nonglycosylated components. </p>

Unfortunately, influenza A strains are the most varied of the three types. They have been isolated from mammalian, avian, and human sources. The influenza A genome consists of eight separate pieces of single-stranded RNA. These eight segments function as distinct genes, so genetic reassortment occurs readily when a host cell is infected with two strains of the virus. Influenza B and C strains have been isolated from human infections. The B strains of the virus are less lethal and often cause illness within more youthful populations. In general, mortality rates are low with strain B viruses. Less is known about the C strains, but they are not the cause of epidemics. </p>

                    <p align="justify">The first influenza B strain virus was isolated in 1940 during an epidemic in New York City. Influenza B virus seems to progress by causing localized outbreaks, chiefly in school children but sporadic cases do occur in adults, as well. It is very difficult to discern the level of antigenic variation in type B influenza. The viruses isolated during some of the larger outbreaks possessed variations within the haemagglutinin molecule. These variations were not comparable to any other previous forms of influenza B virus. This seems to suggest that once one form of B strain virus emerges, it is highly unlikely that another strain with similar serological qualities will return. The slow antigenic drift of the influenza B virus, unlike that of type A, allows time for human populations to acquire imminity, and eventually halt the spread of the virus. </p>

                    <p align="justify">Spread of infection is by direct contact. It is generally accepted that influenza viruses are maintained in humans by direct person-to-person contact. Infection begins in the upper respiratory tract by inhalation of droplets emanating from the respiratory tract of an infected individual. The virus first replicates in ciliated columnar epithelial cells of the respiratory tract. From there, they become included into respiratory secretions and spread by small-particle aerosols generated during sneezing, coughing, and speaking. </p>
                    <p align="justify">As soon as the virion encounters an epithelial cell of the respiratory tract, a receptor on the surface of that host cell interacts with the haemaggultinin on the surafce of the viral particle. The virion then attaches and is immediately included into a coated pit that develops within the cell membrane. The haemaggultinin then splits into two parts, H1 and H2, by a host cell protease. As the molecule is split, the surafce of the viral particle. The virion then attaches and is immediately included into a coated pit that develops within the cell membrane. The haemcoated pit containing the virion is transported into the cytoplasm. The viral core is then translocated into the nucleus where replication begins. </p>
                    <p align="justify">The incubation period for influenza (1-4 days) is short. The ability for the virus to infect large populations suggests that a single infected person can transmit the virus to a large number of susceptible individuals. Within a few hours after infection begins, 100 or more incomplete virions can be demonstrated by electron microscopy at the periphery of the cytoplasm just below the cell membrane. During that time, they are wrapped in a lipid coat, and eventually emerge as buds on the cell surface. They remain there until the neurominidase protein releases the mature viral particles into the interstitial space, where they can invade and destroy the next appropriate cell they encounter. Each invasion results in the death of the host cell, which is shed into the lumen of the respiratory tract.</p>

                    <p align="justify">Avian species provide a stable reservoir for maintaining viral gene sequences that emerge as recombinants for reintroduction into human populations. Avian influenza viruses have not changed much in antigenic structure in the last 60 years, in contrast to human and other mammalian flu strains that have undergone extensive antigenic variablity over that same time period. However, recent outbreaks in China among populations of domestic chickens with the rare H5/N1 strain illustrate the high degree of unpredicability regarding emergence of antigenic types with the avian flu viruses. In birds, influenza viruses replicate in the epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract, and are excreted in great quantity into the environment. Migrating waterfowl expose large numbers of domestic waterfowl to them each year on their way to their nesting grounds. </p>
                    <p align="justify">In humans, viral replication is restricted to the respiratory tract. Human strains of flu virus replicate in pigs, but not very well in birds. In contrast, the pig is a permissive host for both the human and bird strains. Because of this unusual feature, in humans, viral replication is restricted to the respiratory tract. Human strains of flu virus replicate in pigs, but not very well in birds. In contrt is beleived that pigs are important in maintaining bird and human strains of the virus together in one place. Pigs are thought to serve as a &#8220;mixing vessel,&#8221; allowing for genetic exchange between avian and human viruses when the same cell is infected with both types of virus. Passage of human and avian strains of virus through pigs may also expose the virus to various selective pressures that allow antigenically unique, and often more virulent strains to emerge.</p>
                    <p align="justify">In China, pigs and waterfowl, such as domestic geese and ducks, are kept in close proximity to one another, and to large numbers of humans that tend them. This allows for the possibility of frequent infections in pigs with both human and bird strains of the virus. The results can be devastating. Nowhere else on earth is this situation present to such a degree. Hence, most epidemics of influenza are believed to have their origins in China.</p>

                    <h5><strong>Introduction</strong></h5>
                    <p>Influenza is a common, usually mild infection in non-domestic waterfowl that can cause serious disease in domestic waterfowl and humans. Myriad strains are ubiquitous in animal reservoirs, hence its ecology encompasses all those wildlife networks favouring the maintenance of strain diversity among wild bird populations. Unlike other highly contagious viruses, such as measles and smallpox, influenza viruses have the potential for continuous antigenic shift and drift due to their unique segmented viral genomes. These general biological characteristics help set the stage for its potential for causing pandemic outbreaks in humans, as well as in avian populations. Understanding the interfaces between host susceptibility, strain diversity, and animal reservoirs is critical for developing models for prediction of epidemics, and their control and prevention. </p>

                    <h5><strong>The Virus: </<img src="6-1.gif" width="502" height="380" border="1"></p>
                    <p align="justify">This classification system has characterized pandemics of the 20 th century: H1N1 Spanish flu in 1918, H2N2 Asian flu in 1957, H3N2 Hong Kong flu in 1968 and an H1N1 Russian flu in 1977 with the ethnicities attached as somewhat misnomers, indicating only the location in which epidemic case numbers were first documented. One hypothesis suggested that pandemics could be caused by a viral strain to which humans were na&iuml;ve (i.e., had no immunity), and that these new antigenic types arose from antigenic drift of human viruses and/or genetic recombination of human viruses with animal viruses in a "mixing vessel", usually pigs.</p>
                    <p><strong>Why are swine 'mixing vessels'? </strong></p>
                    <p align="justify">HA binds to various sialic acids depending upon species specificity and the linkages of these sialic acids to galactose on host surface cells. While avian influenza viruses bind preferentially to one type of linkage with sialic acid (alpha 2,3) human viruses bind primarily to another (alpha 2,6), and swine influenza viruses can bind to either of these linkages, creating a 'mixing vessel' for viruses of birds and humans. Essentially, pigs are mixing vessels because their respiratory epithelial cells have the receptors for y to another (alpha 2,6), and swine influenza viruses can bind to either of these linkages, creating a 'mixing vessel' for viruses of birds and humansboth human and avian influenza viruses, which allows for co-infection and subsequent recombination events. However, humans could very well become 'mixing vessels' since the airway epithelial cells in humans contain receptors for both avian and human influenza viruses. </p>

                    <p align="justify">Although strain types are characterized by their H and N surface glycoproteins, strain pathogenicity is also dictated by other factors, including the gamut of H, N, viral genes, and host factors (e.g., immune response genes, age, sex), as well. </p>

                    <p align="justify">Influenza strain diversity is defined by two glycoproteins on the surface of the virion. The first stage of infection with the virus is mediated by the hemagglutinin (HA) membrane glycoprotein that allows for binding and fusion         <p align="justify">Influenza strain diversity is defined by two glycoproteins on the surface of the virion. The first stage of infection with with host cells. The other major glycoprotein, neuraminidase, facilitates viral budding and exit from the host cell. These two glycoproteins exhibit great structural diversity, and at least 15 hemagglutinin and 9 neuraminidase subtypes have been identified to date. However, only viruses of hemagglutinin subtypes H1, H2, and H3 and neuraminidase subtypes of N1 and N2 are currently circulating in the human population. Avian species are considered the predominant natural hosts for viruses composed of other glycoprotein subtypes (see diagram) although a variety of animal species have been infected with various viruses.</p>
                    <p align="justify">This theory was challenged in 1997 when an avian influenza strain H5N1 infected 18 people in Hong Kong, with a 33% case-fatality rate. This highly virulent strain of chicken influenza, H5N1, was of avian origin and had not re-assorted with human viruses, infecting humans in direct contact with those domestic fowl. Since 1997, several mini-outbreaks of H5N1 have occurred each year in Southeast Asia, with similar mortality rates. Fortunately, the avian origins of this virus have not allowed for person-to-person transmission, although case reports in early 2005 suggested the possibility of person-to-person transmission in rural China. </p>

                    <p align="justify">Avian viral strain H9N2 in 1998 also caused human infection. This virus bore no evidence of recombination, even though its binding properties more closely resembled that of human influenza virus origin rather than from any avian strain. Illness was "mild and self-limited". An avian virus, H7N7, in the Netherlands in 2003, caused an outbreak amongst poultry farmers and their families. Although this strain was not particularly pathogenic, person-to-person transmission was documented. Taking this data into account, in the late 1990s, a shift in thinking about the nature of influenza outbreaks allowed for the possibility that avian viruses are indeed potential pandemic threats. </p>
                    <p>&nbsp; </p>
                    <h5><strong>What should we do? </strong></h5>
                    <p align="justify">How can the scientific community predict which strain is the most likely candidate to cause the next pandemic? Equally important, how can the world best prepare for such an event? The H1N1 and H3N2 are the current primary circulating strains in the human population, buientific community predict which strain is the most likely candidate to cause the next pandemic? Equally important, how can the world best prepare fort the high virulence of the H5N1 strain has elicited speculation as to whether this or other related avian strains are capable of causing pandemic influenza. In order for any of the avian influenza viruses to evolve into one capable of person-to-person transmission, many changes in the genome of the virion would have to precede such an event. The current person-to-person capability of the virulent H5N1 is extremely low or non-existent, due to the fact that the hemagglutinin molecule is not configured properly to interact with human cell surface receptor proteins of the respiratory tract. The virulence of the transmissible H7N7 is mild, so the probability is low of these strains becoming a major worldwide health risk. Noteworthy is the fact that humans do not have any immunity to H5, hence this strain is highly pathogenic, and in many cases lethal. Even though the odds are small of the H5N1 strain becoming capable of human to human transmission, the accumulation of a series of point mutations could eventually allow for person-to-person spread, and could thus cause a pandemic even greater than 1918. Whether 'mixing' vessels, antigenic drift, or other mutational accumulations will lead to its emergence cannot yet be determined. In addition, the continuing circulation of H1N1 and H3N2 raises further concerns as to their epidemiological fate. </p>

                    <h5><strong>Vaccines</strong></h5>
                    <p align="justify">Influenza vaccine development is an unreliable variable in helping to quell viral pandemicity. Annual worldwide vaccine usage of over 300 million doses requires more than six months and 350 million chicken eggs to meet that demand. These constraints and other extraneous factors, such as the microbial contamination of vaccines manufactured in the past year in the UK , leaves influenza vaccine technology currently in a state of disconnect with imminent pandemic threats and the corresponding health demands. The detection of a novel strain in the human population may render subsequent vaccine development too long a process on which to rely for protection. Current vaccines (killed-virus) contain H1 and H3 components. Obviously, the lack of other HA components in these vaccines is a major flaw in the control strategy, particularly with respect to the number of recent avian influenza outbreaks in humans. Alternatively, since H2 has also established a propensity for infection in humans, this strain should be considered as part and parcel of the standard antigenic mix.</p>
                    <p align="justify">Although these pandemic flu scenarios depict a less than satisfactory situation, several measures in preparation for such an event is strain should be considered as part and parcel of the standard antigenic mix.</p>
                    <p align="justify">Although these pandemic flmay mitigate or prevent such a pandemic. Continued surveillance efforts both in humans (particularly in Southeast Asia ) and animal (avian) species must be stepped up and reinforced. Continued research into vaccine design, development, and rapid scale-up production methods is essential. Other efforts could include the stockpiling of antiviral drugs, and a greater commitment by governments to an early warning system. </p>
                    <p><strong>Why is the current influenza vaccine technology unreliable? </strong></p>
                    <p>Influenza virus is a 'shape-shifter,' so every year new strategies must be devised to design a vaccine against the predicted flu strain for that year. This has proven difficult because of the uncertainty of which influenza strain will actually emerge. Frequently, these vaccines are based on the previous year's strains. Ultimately, researchers are trying to design a vaccine that could confer immunity to all influenza strains. However, as of yet, this 'Holy Grail' has not been discovered. The prospects for a DNA-based vaccine is also being investigated, as well as RNA interference, and new antivirals. </p>

                      temperatures, the World Health Organization said on Fri 20 Jan  2006.</p>

It  has been found from South Korea,  across South East Asia, into Turkey,  Ukraine and Romania. It has  infected 149 people and killed 80, according to the WHO figures, which do not  include the most recent deaths and infections in Turkey.</p>
                    <p align="justify">Bird droppings may be a significant source of its spread to both  people and 
                      birds, the WHO said. For example, the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus  can 
                      survive in bird feces for at least 35 days at low temperature (4  degrees C 
                      or 39 degrees F). At a much higher temperature (37 degrees C or  98.6 
                      degrees F), H5N1 viruses have been shown to survive, in fecal  samples, for 
                      6 days.</p>
                    <p align="justify">Poultry, especially those kept in small backyard flocks, are the  main 
                      source of the virus. &quot;These birds usually roam freely as they  scavenge for 
                      food and often mingle with wild birds or share water sources with  them. 
                      Such situations create abundant opportunities for human exposure  to the

                      households during adverse weather, or when they share areas where  children 
                      play or sleep, WHO states.</p>
                    <p align="justify">According to WHO, H5N1 has different qualities from seasonal flu.  The 
                      incubation period for H5N1 avian influenza may be longer than that  for 
                      normal seasonal influenza, which is around 2 to 3 days. Current  data for 
                      H5N1 infection indicate an incubation period ranging from 2 to 8  days and 
                      possibly as long as 17 days. Initial symptoms include a high  fever, usually 
                      with a temperature higher than 38 degrees C (100.4 degrees F), and 
                      influenza-like symptoms. Diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, chest  pain, 
                      and bleeding from the nose and gums have also been reported as  early 
                      symptoms in some patients. And with H5N1 infection, all patients  have 
                      developed pneumonia, and usually very early on the illness, WHO  states. On 
                      present evidence, difficulty in breathing develops around 5 days  following 
                      the 1st symptoms. Respiratory distress, a hoarse voice, and a  crackling

                      common feature is multi-organ dysfunction, notably involving the  kidney and 
                      heart. The WHO recommends using Tamiflu, known generically as  oseltamivir, 
                      as soon as possible to treat bird flu.</p>
                    <p align="justify">WHO stresses that H5N1 remains mostly a disease of birds, with  tens of millions infected in 2 years. For unknown reasons, most cases have  occurred 
                      in rural and peri-urban households where small flocks of poultry  are kept. 
                      Again for unknown reasons, very few cases have been detected in  presumed 
                      high-risk groups, such as commercial poultry workers, workers at  live

                      though some species are more resistant to infection than others.  Infection

                      highly contagious and rapidly fatal disease resulting in severe  epidemics. 
                      The latter is known as &quot;highly pathogenic avian  influenza.&quot; This form is 
                      characterized by sudden onset, severe illness, and rapid death,  with a 
                      mortality that can approach 100 per cent.</p>

                      of avian influenza viruses, and these birds are also the most  resistant to

                      particularly susceptible to epidemics of rapidly fatal influenza.</p>
                    <p align="justify">Direct or indirect contact of domestic flocks with wild migratory  waterfowl 
                      has been implicated as a frequent cause of epidemics. Live bird  markets 
                      have also played an important role in the spread of epidemics.</p>
                    <p align="justify">Recent research has shown that viruses of low pathogenicity can,  after 
                      circulation for sometimes short periods in a poultry population,  mutate 
                      into highly pathogenic viruses. During a 1983-1984 epidemic in the  United 
                      States of America, the H5N2 virus initially caused low mortality,  but 
                      within 6 months became highly pathogenic, with a mortality  approaching 90

                  n birds at a cost of nearly USD65 million. During a  1999-2001 
                      epidemic in Italy,  the H7N1 virus, initially of low pathogenicity, mutated 
                      within 9 months to a highly pathogenic form. More than 13 million  birds 
                      died or were destroyed.</p>
                    <p align="justify">The quarantining of infected farms and destruction of infected or 
                      potentially exposed flocks are standard control measures aimed at 
                      preventing spread to other farms and eventual establishment of the  virus in 
                      a country's poultry population. Apart from being highly  contagious, avian 
                      influenza viruses are readily transmitted from farm to farm by  mechanical 
                      means, such as by contaminated equipment, vehicles, feed, cages,  or 
                      clothing. Highly pathogenic viruses can survive for long periods  in the 
                      environment, especially when temperatures are low. Stringent  sanitary 
                      measures on farms can, however, confer some degree of protection.</p>

                      epidemics can last for years. For example, an epidemic of H5N2  avian

                      All type A influenza viruses, including those that regularly cause  seasonal 
                      epidemics of influenza in humans, are genetically labile and well  adapted 
                      to elude host defenses. Influenza viruses lack mechanisms for the&quot;proofreading&quot; and repair of errors that occur during  replication. As a 
                      result of these uncorrected errors, the genetic composition of the  viruses 
                      changes as they replicate in humans and animals, and the existing  strain is 
                      replaced with a new antigenic variant. These constant, permanent  and 
                      usually small changes in the antigenic composition of influenza A  viruses 
                    are known as antigenic drift.</p>
                    <p align="justify">The tendency of influenza viruses to undergo frequent and  permanent 
                      antigenic changes necessitates constant monitoring of the global  influenza

                      antigenic changes necessitates he composition of influenza  vaccines. 
                      Both activities have been a cornerstone of the WHO Global  Influenza 
                      Program since its inception in 1947.</p>
                    <p align="justify">Influenza viruses have a 2nd characteristic of great public health  concern: 
                      influenza A viruses, including subtypes from different species,  can swap or  &quot;re-assort&quot; genetic materials and merge. This  re-assortment process, known as 
                      antigenic shift, results in a novel subtype different from both  parent 
                      viruses. As populations will have no immunity to the new subtype,  and as no 
                      existing vaccines can confer protection, antigenic shift has  historically 
                      resulted in highly lethal pandemics. For this to happen, the novel  subtype 
                      needs to have genes from human influenza viruses that make it  readily 
                      transmissible from person to person for a sustainable period.</p>
                    <p align="justify">Conditions favorable for the emergence of antigenic shift have  long been 
                      thought to involve humans living in close proximity to domestic  poultry and 
                      pigs. Because pigs are susceptible to infection with both avian  and favorable for the emergence of antigenic shift have  long been 
                      thought to involve humans living in close proximity to domestic 
                      mammalian viruses, including human strains, they can serve as a  &quot;mixing 
                      vessel&quot; for the scrambling of genetic material from human and  avian 
                      viruses, resulting in the emergence of a novel subtype.</p>
                    <p align="justify">Recent events, however, have identified a 2nd possible mechanism.  Evidence 
                      is mounting that, for at least some of the 15 avian influenza  virus 
                      subtypes circulating in bird populations, humans themselves can  serve as 
                      the &quot;mixing vessel.&quot;</p>

                      Avian influenza viruses do not normally infect species other than  birds and 
                      pigs. The 1st documented infection of humans with an avian  influenza virus 
                      occurred in Hong Kong in 1997,  when the H5N1 strain caused severe 
                      respiratory disease in 18 humans, of whom 6 died. The infection of  humans 
                      coincided with an epidemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza,  caused by 
                      the same strain, in Hong Kong's  poultry population.</p>

                      live infected poultry was the source of human infection. Studies  at the 
                      genetic level further determined that the virus had jumped  directly from 
                      birds to humans. Limited transmission to health care workers  occurred, but 
                      did not cause severe disease.</p>
                    <p align="justify">Rapid destruction -- within 3 days -- of Hong   Kong's entire poultry 
                      population, estimated at around 1.5 million birds, reduced  opportunities 
                      for further direct transmission to humans, and may have averted a  pandemic.</p>
                    <p align="justify">That event alarmed public health authorities, as it marked the 1st  time 
                      that an avian influenza virus was transmitted directly to humans  and caused 
                      severe illness with high mortality. Alarm mounted again in  February 2003, 
                      when an outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza in Hong   Kong caused 2 cases and 1 
                      death in members of a family who had recently traveled to southern  China. 
                      Another child in the family died during that visit, but the cause  of death

                      Netherlands in February 2003, caused the death of one  veterinarian 2 months 
                      later, and mild illness in 83 other humans. Mild cases of avian  influenza 
                      H9N2 in children occurred in Hong Kong  in 1999 (2 cases) and in 
                      mid-December 2003 (one case). H9N2 is not highly pathogenic in  birds.</p>
                    <p align="justify">The most recent cause for alarm occurred in January 2004, when  laboratory 
                      tests confirmed the presence of H5N1 avian influenza virus in  human cases 
                      of severe respiratory disease in the northern part of Viet Nam.</p>

                      Of the 15 avian influenza virus subtypes, H5N1 is of particular  concern for 
                      several reasons. H5N1 mutates rapidly and has a documented  propensity to 
                      acquire genes from viruses infecting other animal species. Its  ability to 
                      cause severe disease in humans has now been documented on 2  occasions. In 
 H5N1 mutates rapidly and has a documented  propensity to 
                      acquire genes from viruses infecting other animal species. Its  abili                      addition, laboratory studies have demonstrated that isolates from  this 
                      virus have a high pathogenicity and can cause severe disease in  humans. 
                      Birds that survive infection excrete virus for at least 10 days,  orally and 
                      in feces, thus facilitating further spread at live poultry markets  and by 
                      migratory birds.</p>
                    <p align="justify">The epidemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by H5N1,  which 
                      began in mid-December 2003 in the Republic of Korea  and is now being seen 
                      in other Asian countries, is therefore of particular public health  concern. 
                      H5N1 variants demonstrated a capacity to directly infect humans in  1997, 
                      and have done so again in Viet Nam in January 2004. The  spread of infection 
                      in birds increases the opportunities for direct infection of  humans. If 
                      more humans become infected over time, the likelihood also  increases that 
                      humans, if concurrently infected with human and avian influenza  strains, 
                      could serve as the &quot;mixing vessel&quot; for the emergence of  a novel subtype 
                      with sufficient humanes that 
                      humans, if concurrently infected with human and avian influenza  strains, 
                      could serve as the &qu genes to be easily transmitted from person  to person. 
                      Such an event would mark the start of an influenza pandemic.</p>
                    <p align="justify"><strong>E. Influenza pandemics: can they be averted?</strong><br>
                      Based on historical patterns, influenza pandemics can be expected  to occur, 
                      on average, 3-4 times each century when new virus subtypes emerge  and are 
                      readily transmitted from person to person. However, the occurrence  of 
                      influenza pandemics is unpredictable. In the 20th century, the  great 
                      influenza pandemic of 1918-1919, which caused an estimated 40 to  50 million 
                      deaths worldwide, was followed by pandemics in 1957-1958 and  1968-1969.</p>
                    <p align="justify">Experts agree that another influenza pandemic is inevitable and  possibly 
                      imminent. Most influenza experts also agree that the prompt  culling of Hong Kong's entire poultry  population in 1997 probably averted a pandemic.</p>
                    <p align="justify">Several measures can help minimize the global public health risks  that 
                      could arise from large outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza

                      could arise from larrity is to halt further spread of  epidemics in 
                      poultry populations. This strategy works to reduce opportunities  for human 
                      exposure to the virus. Vaccination of persons at high risk of  exposure to 
                      infected poultry, using existing vaccines effective against  currently 
                      circulating human influenza strains, can reduce the likelihood of 
                      co-infection of humans with avian and influenza strains, and thus  reduce 
                      the risk that genes will be exchanged. Workers involved in the culling  of 
                      poultry flocks must be protected, by proper clothing and  equipment, against 
                      infection. These workers should also receive antiviral drugs as a 
                      prophylactic measure.</p>

                      influenza infection in animals as well as humans and on  circulating 
                      influenza viruses is urgently needed to aid the assessment of  risks to 
                      public health and to guide the best protective measures.</p>
                    <p align="justify">Thorough investigation of each case is also essential. While WHO  and the

                      agencies, can assist with many of these activities, the successful 
                      containment of public health risks also depends on the  epidemiological and 
                      laboratory capacity of affected countries and the adequacy of  surveillance 
                      systems already in place.</p>

                      will emerge, the question of whether another influenza pandemic  can be 
                      averted cannot be answered with certainty.</p>

                      outbreak. In that outbreak, patients developed symptoms of fever,  sore 
                      throat, cough and, in several of the fatal cases, severe  respiratory

                      tests as well as considerable experience. Rapid bedside tests for  the

                      Vaccination is the best way  to prevent influenza (3). Although influenza 
                      vaccinations begin in  October, vaccination in December and beyond is still 
                      beneficial; influenza  activity usually does not peak in the United States 
                      until December--March (3).  The degree of antigenic match between the 
                      current vaccine strains and  strains that will circulate this season will be 
                      determined as more strains  become available for analysis.</p>
                    <p>Influenza surveillance  reports for the United    States are posted online 
                      weekly during October--May  and are available at <br>
  &lt;<u>http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/fluactivity.htm</u>&gt;. Additional information

                    <p>Sporadic cases of avian  influenza A (H5N1) in humans continue to be 
                      reported in Asia; in November, for the first time during the current <br>

                      cases (4). The majority of  cases appear to have been acquired from direct 
                      contact with infected  poultry. No evidence of sustained human-to-human 
                      transmission of H5N1 has  been detected, although rare cases of 
                    human-to-human transmission  likely have occurred (5).</p>
                    <p>Recently, influenza A  (H5N1) was reported for the first time in avian 
                      species in Europe (6), although the likely Asian origin of the  outbreaks 
                      has been confirmed by virus  sequencing analysis and virus isolation (7). 
                      This westward spread of  disease might be attributed to transport of virus 
                      by wild migratory birds  from Asia (8); further research is needed to  better 
                    understand the role of  migratory birds in the current H5N1 epizootic.</p>
                    <p>CDC continues to recommend  enhanced surveillance for suspected H5N1 cases 
                      among travelers with  unexplained severe respiratory illness returning from 
                      H5N1-affected countries (1)  as a defense against further spread of the 
                      disease from H5N1-affected  countries. Additional informatio among travelers with  unexplained severe respiratory illness returning from
