AIDS awareness was soon brought to the public's						consciousness, when popular film star, Rock Hudson, died of AIDS on October 2, 1985,						shortly after making public his AIDS on July 25, 1985, thus becoming the first major						public figure to announce that he had AIDS. Another entertainer, the pianist Liberace						died of AIDS on February 4, 1987. Many other well known personalities from the entertainment						industry added their familiar faces to the cumulative weight of the AIDS crisis,						when they succumbed to AIDS: (1) Amanda Blake (Miss Kitty of <I>Gunsmoke</I>) died						in 1989 of AIDS related throat cancer, (2) Anthony Perkins (Norman Bates of Hitchcock's						<I>Psycho</I>) died in 1992 of pneumonia brought on by AIDS, (3) Robert Reed (Mike						Brady of <I>The Brady Bunch</I>) died in 1992 of intestinal cancer and complications						of AIDS, and (4) Dack Rambo (Jack Ewing of <I>Dallas</I>) died in 1994 of complications						of AIDS. What are the complications of AIDS? Any secondary condition, symptom, or						other disorder caused by an AIDS weakened immune system is a complication of AIDS,						so that any number of opportunistic infections can take advantage of that weakness.						An opportunistic infection (OI) occurs, when the germs normally in our body take						advantage of the weakness of the immune system to cause health problems. If you have						HIV <I>and</I> any of a list of about 24 designated Center for Disease Control opportunistic						infections, then you have AIDS. Some of the more common opportunistic infections						in conjunction with HIV are: (1) PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia), (2) KS (Kaposi's sarcoma),		 list of about 24 designated Center for Disease Control opportunistic						infections, then you have AIDS. Some of the more common opportunistic infections						in conjunction with HIV are: (1) PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia), (2) KS (Kaposi				(3) CMV (Cytomegalovirus, an infection usually affecting the eyes), (4) Candidiasis						(Thrush: an infection of the mouth, throat, or vagina), (5) Mycobacterium tuberculosis						(TB), and (6) Herpes simplex (can cause oral herpes or genital herpes). <I>Source:						</I></FONT><A HREF="http://www.aidsinfonet.org/articles.php?articleID=500#anchor51213"><FONT						SIZE="4"><I>New Mexico AIDS InfoNet</I></FONT></A></P>						<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A HREF="history-of-aids-2.html"><FONT SIZE="4"><B><BR>						</B></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="4"><B>&lt;&lt; History of AIDS last page || </B></FONT><A						HREF="history-of-aids-2.html"><FONT SIZE="4"><B>History of AIDS next page &gt;&gt;</B></FONT></A></P>						<P ALIGN="CENTER"><I>The History of AIDS &copy; 2005</I><BR>						<FONT SIZE="2">Legal Disclaimer: &quot;The History of AIDS&quot; is not affiliated						in any way with the organizations, or third party links found at this website, with						the exception of links to Amazon.com.
