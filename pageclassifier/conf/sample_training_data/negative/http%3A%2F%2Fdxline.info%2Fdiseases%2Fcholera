    <h2>Cholera</h2><div><p><strong>Cholera</strong>, sometimes known as <strong>Asiatic</strong> or <strong>epidemic cholera</strong>, is an infectious gastroenteritis caused by enterotoxin-producing strains of the bacterium ''Vibrio cholera>
    </div>
    <h2>Cholera</h2><div><p><strong>Cholera</strong>, sometimes known as <strong>Asiatic</strong> or <strong>epidemic cholera</strong>, is an infe''. Transmission to humans occurs through eating food or drinking water contaminated with ''Vibrio cholerae'' from other cholera patients. The major reservoir for cholera was long assumed to be humans themselves, but considerable evidence exists that aquatic environments can serve as reservoirs of the bacteria.</p><p>''Vibrio cholerae'' is a Gram-negative bacterium that produces cholera toxin, an enterotoxin, whose action on the mucosal epithelium lining of the small intestine is responsible for the disease's most salient characteristic, exhaustive diarrhea.</p><p>The majority of reported gross cholera cases worldwide occur in Africa. It is estimated that most cases of cholera are unreported due to poor surveillance systems, particularly in Africa. Fatality rates are 5% of total cases in Africa, and less than 1% elsewhere. </p><p>In most cases cholera can be successfully treated with oral rehydration therapy. Prompt replacement of water and electrolytes is the principal treatment for cholera, as dehydration and electrolyte depletion occur rapidly. Oral rehydration therapy or ORT is highly effective, safe, and simple to administer. In situations where commercially produced ORT sachets are too expensive or difficult to obtain, alternative homemade solutions using various formulas of water, sugar, table salt, baking soda, and fruit offer less expensive methodsnd simple to administer. In situations where commercially produced ORT sachets are too expensive or difficult to obtain, alternative homemade solution of electrolyte repletion (i.e. Gatorade or Powerade). In severe cholera cases with significant dehydration, the administration of intravenous rehydration solutions may be necessary.</p><p>Antibiotics shorten the course of the disease, and reduce the severity of the symptoms. However Oral rehydration therapy remains the principal treatment. Tetracycline is typically used as the primary antibiotic, although some strains of ''V. cholerae'' exist that have shown resistance. Other antibiotics that have been proven effective against ''V. cholerae'' include cotrimoxazole, erythromycin, doxycycline, chloramphenicol, and furazolidone. Fluoroquinolones such as norfloxacin also may be used, but resistance has been reported.</p><p>Rapid diagnostic assay methods are available for the identification of multidrug resistant ''V. cholerae''. New generation antimicrobials have been discovered which are effective against ''V. cholerae'' in ''in vitro'' studies.</p><p>The success of treatment is significantly affected by the speed and method of treatment. If cholera patients are treated quickly and properly, the mortality rate is less than 1%; however, with untreated cholera the mortality rate rises to 50–60%.</p>  <p>  This article is licensed under the  Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License.

Treatment is usually started without or before confirmation by laboratory analysis of specimens.</p><p>Stool and swab samples collected in the acute stage of the disease, before antibiotics have been administered, are the most useful specimens for laboratory diagnosis. If an epidemic of cholera is suspected, the most common causative agent is ''Vibrio cholerae'' O1. If ''V. cholerae'' serogroup O1 is not isolated, the laboratory should test for ''V. cholerae'' O139. However, if neither of these organisms is isolated, it is necessary to send stool specimens to a reference laboratory.</p><p>Infection with ''V. cholerae'' O139 should be reported and handled in the same manner as that caused by ''V. cholerae'' O1. The associated diarrheal illness should be referred to as cholera and must be reported as a case of cholera to the appropriate public health authorities. The few bacteria that do survive conserve their energy and stored nutrients during the passage through the stomach by shuteal illness should be referred to as cholera and must be reported as a case of cholera to the appropriate public health authorities. The few bacteria tting down much protein production. When the surviving bacteria exit the stomach and reach the small intestine, they need to propel themselves through the thick mucus that lines the small intestine to get to the intestinal wall where they can thrive. ''V. cholerae'' bacteria start up production of the hollow cylindrical protein flagellin to make flagella, the curly whip-like tails that they rotate to propel themselves through the mucus that lines the small intestine.</p><p>Once the cholera bacteria reach the intestinal wall, they do not need the flagella propellers to move themselves any longer. The bacteria stop producing the protein flagellin, thus again conserving energy and nutrients by changing the mix of proteins that they manufacture in response to the changed chemical surroundings. On reaching the intestinal wall, ''V. cholerae'' start producing the toxic proteins that give the infected person a watery diarrhea. This carries the multiplying new generations of ''V. cholerae'' bacteria out into the drinking water of the next host—if proper sanitation measures are not in place.</p><p>Microbiologists have studied the genetic mechanisms by which the ''V. cholerae'' bacteria turn off the production of some proteins and turn on the production of other proteins as they respond to the series of chemical environments they encounter, passing through the stomach, through the mucous layer of the small intestine, and on to the intestinal wall. Of particular interest have been the genetic mechanisms by which cholera bacteria turn on the protein production of the toxins that interact with host cell mechanisms to pump chloride ions into the small intestine, creating an ionic pressure which prevents sodium ions from entering the cell. The chloride and sodium ions create a salt water environment in the small intestines which through osmosis can pull up to six liters of water per day through the intestinal cells creating the massive amounts of diarrhea. The host can become rapidly dehydrated if an appropriate mixture of dilute salt water and sugar is not taken to replace the blood's water and salts lost in the diarrhea.</p><p>By inserting separate, successive sections of ''V. cholerae'' DNA into the DNA of other bacteria such as ''E. coli'' that would not naturally produce the protein toxins, researchers have investigated the mechanisms by which ''V. cholerae'' responds to the changing chemical environments of the stomach, mucous layers, and intestinal wall. Researchers have discovered that there is a complex cascade of regulatory proteins that control expression of ''V. cholerae'' virulence determinants. In responding to the chemical environment at the intestinal wall, the ''V. cholerae'' bacteria produce the TcpP/TcpH pave discovered that there is a complex cascade roteins, which, together with the ToxR/ToxS proteins, activate the expression of the ToxT regulatory protein. ToxT then directly activates expression of virulence genes that produce the toxins that cause diarrhea in the infected person and that permit the bacteria to colonize the intestine. Current research aims at discovering &quot;the signal that makes the cholera bacteria stop swimming and start to colonize (that is, adhere to the cells of) the small intestine.&quot; The cholera outbreak extended as far as China, Indonesia (where more than 100,000 people succumbed on the island of Java alone) and the Caspian Sea before receding. Deaths in India between 1817 and 1860 are estimated to have exceeded 15 million persons. Another 23 million died between 1865 and 1917. Russian deaths during a similar time period exceeded 2 million.</p>            <p>  This article is licensed under the  Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License.

Between these two extremes are the A and B blood types, with type A being more resistant than type B.</p><p>About one million ''V. cholerae'' bacteria must typically be ingested to cause cholera in normally healthy adults, although increased susceptibility may be observed in those with a weakened immune system, individuals with decreased gastric acidity (as from the use of antacids), or those who are malnourished.</p><p>It has also been hypothesized that the cystic fibrosis genetic mutation has been maintained in humans due to a selective advantage: heterozygous carriers of the mutation (who are thus not affected by cystic fibrosis) are more resistant to ''V. cholerae'' infections. In this model, the genetic deficiency in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator channel proteins interferes with bacteria binding to the gastrointestinal epithelium, thus reducing the effects of an infection.</p>          <p>  This article is licensed under the  Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License.

In the first world, due to nearly universal advanced water treatment and sanitation practices, cholera is no longer a major health threat. The last major outbreak of cholera in the United States occurred in 1910-1911. During recent years, substantial progress has been made in developing new oral vaccines against cholera. Two oral cholera vaccines, which have been evaluated with volunteers from industrialized countries and in regions with endemic cholera, are commercially available in several countries: a killed whole-cell ''V. cholerae'' O1 in combination with purified recombinant B subunit of cholera toxin and a live-attenuated live oral cholera vaccine, containing the genetically manipulated ''V. cholerae'' O1 strain CVD 103-HgR. The appearance of ''V. cholerae'' O139 has influenced efforts in order to develop an effective and practical cholera vaccine since none of the currently available vaccines is effective against this strain.</p><p>The newer vaccine (brand name: ''Dukoral''), an orally administered inactivated whole cell vaccine, appears to provide somewhat better immunity and have fewer adverse effect none of the currently available vaccines is effective against this strain.</p><p>The newer vaccine (brand name: ''Dukoral''), an orally administered s than the previously available vaccine.</p><p>Sensitive surveillance and prompt reporting allow for containing cholera epidemics rapidly. Cholera exists as a seasonal disease in many endemic countries, occurring annually mostly during rainy seasons. Surveillance systems can provide early alerts to outbreaks, therefore leading to coordinated response and assist in preparation of preparedness plans. Efficient surveillance systems can also improve the risk assessment for potential cholera outbreaks. Understanding the seasonality and location of outbreaks provide guidance for improving cholera control activities for the most vulnerable. This will also aid in the developing indicators for appropriate use of oral cholera vaccine.</p>          <p>  This article is licensed under the  Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License.

Cholera is><h2>Cholera Transmission</h2><div><p>People infected with cholera suffer acute diarrhea. This highly liquid diarrhea, colloquially referred to as &quo transmitted from person to person through ingestion of water contaminated with the cholera bacterium, usually from faeces or other effluent. The source of the contamination is typically other cholera patients when their untreated diarrhea discharge is allowed to get into waterways or into groundwater or drinking water supplies. Any infected water and any foods washed in the water, as well as shellfish living in the affected waterway, can cause an infection. Cholera is rarely spread directly from person to person. ''V. cholerae'' harbors naturally in the zooplankton of fresh, brackish, and salt water, attached primarily to their chitinous exoskeleton. Both toxic and non-toxic strains exist. Non-toxic strains can acquire toxicity through a lysogenic bacteriophage. Coastal cholera outbreaks typically follow zooplankton blooms, thus making cholera a zoonotic disease.</p><h5>Potential human contribution to transmissibility</h5><p>Cholera bacteria grown ''in vitro'' encounter difficulty subsequently growing in humans without additional stomach acid buffering. In a 2002 study at Tufts University School of Medicine, it was found that stomach acidity is a principal factor that contributes to epidemic spread. In their findings, the researchers found that human colonization creates a hyperinfectious bacterial state that is maintained after dissemination and that may c, it was found that stomach acidity is a principal factor that contributes to epidemic spread. In their findings, the researchers found that human colontribute to epidemic spread of the disease. When these hyperinfectious bacteria underwent transcription profiles, they were found to possess a unique physiological and behavioral state, characterized by high expression levels of genes required for nutrient acquisition and motility, and low expression levels of genes required for bacterial chemotaxis. Thus, the spread of cholera can be expedited by host physiology.</p>            <p>  This article is licensed under the  Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License.
