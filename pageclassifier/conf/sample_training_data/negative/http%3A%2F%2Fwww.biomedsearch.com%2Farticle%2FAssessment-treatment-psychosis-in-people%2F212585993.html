        <td align="left">

            The pathophysiology of psychosis and other forms of severe mental
illness in HIV infection is complex, and multifactorial causation is
likely in most instances. Severe mental illness has been identified as a
risk factor for the acquisition of HIV infection and occurs as both a
manifestation of opportunistic infections and a result of the
neurotropic effects of the virus. (1) A full psychiatric assessment in
people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) presenting with psychosis is
important but may prove difficult in many parts of South Africa. This
paper presents a variety of algorithms to simplify the assessment and
management of an HIV-infected patient with psychosis.

            APPROACH TO PLWHA AND PSYCHOSIS (FIG. 1)<br/><br/>A comprehensive history from the patient and/or caregiver is
needed. There should be special focus on the history of the current
complaint, past psychiatric history, past and present substance abuse
history, full medical history and sexual risk history and the
patient's adherence to previous treatment regimens. Of equal
importance is identification of social support systems.<br/><br/>A mental status examination will need to be conducted. In the
psychotic patient one needs to focus specifically on the behaviour and
appearance of the patient. His or her speech and speed of thoughts
should be assessed, and mood symptoms, affect, suicidality and
neuro-vegetative symptoms evaluated. Perceptual disturbances, thought
form, thought content and finally insight and judgement also need to be
assessed.<br/><br/>A comprehensive and meticulous physical and neurological
examination should be performed to exclude any organic causes for the
presenting psychiatric symptoms. A useful hierarchical approach has been
suggested by Ambrosino et al. (2) One should first examine for signs of
delirium and rule out HIV-associated cognitive disorders. Medical
diagnoses should first be considered and only after that should a
psychiatric diagnosis be entertained. The differential diagnosis needs
to consider the course of the HIV infection, the presence of a
pre-existing psychiatric illness, use of illicit substances and the
presence of cognitive impairment. (3)<br/><br/>PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS IN PLWHA (FIG. 1)<br/><br/><div class="DetTitleBlueText"><div style="width: 728px;float: left;">

<div style="clear: both;"></div></div>A useful delineation may be to divide psychosis in the PLWHA into:
(i) psychiatric disorders predating HIV infection; (ii) new-onset
psychotic disorders; and (iii) disorders associated with medical
conditions (delirium) or substance intoxication or withdrawal, and those
that are likely to be complications of treatment (i.e. antiretrovirals
or antituberculosis drugs). (4)<br/><br/>PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS PREDATING HIV INFECTION<br/><br/>Major psychiatric disorders presenting with psychosis and predating
HIV infection include schizophrenia, bipolar mood disorder and major
depressive disorder with psychotic features. These disorders present
with significant impairment of functioning and follow a chronic course.
(5) Substance abuse may predispose and/ or precipitate a
substance-induced psychotic disorder. There are a multitude of
substances that may cause psychotic symptoms or psychotic disorders, and
a clear collateral history is vital.<br/><br/>NEW-ONSET PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS<br/><br/>New-onset psychosis in the HIV-infected patient is the development
of psychotic symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, disorganised
behaviour, negative otic disorders, and
a clear collateral history is vital.<br/><br/>NEW-ONSET PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS<br/><br/>New-onset psychosis in the HIV-infected patient is the development
of psychotic symptoms (delussymptoms or altered form of thought), either acutely
or subacutely, in the absence of concurrent substance abuse,
opportunistic infections, space-occupying lesions, cognitive impairment
or various medications. It is hypothesised that this is caused by
subcortical neurodegeneration and the direct neurotropic effects of HIV
on the central nervous system (CNS), or is a manifestation of
HIV-associated encephalopathy in the absence of severe HIV-associated
dementia. Some suggest that it is due to an increase in intracellular
free calcium. (6) Rates of new-onset psychosis in HIV-positive patients
have been reported to range from 0.5% to 15%. (7)<br/><br/>[FIGURE 1 OMITTED]<br/><br/>Psychotic symptoms may also occur in the presence of major
HIV-related mood disorders. In a Ugandan study in which HIV-negative
patients with primary mania and patients with HIV-related secondary
mania were compared, the patients with secondary mania were more
irritable, aggressive and disruptive and had a higher rate of psychotic
symptoms than those with primary mania. (8) Finally, new-onset psychotic
symptoms may also occur in the presence of HIV related-cognitive
disorders. (9)<br/><br/>PSYCHOSIS ASSOCIATED WITH MEDICAL CONDITIONS, SUBSTANCE
INTOXICATION, SUBSTANCE WITHDRAWAL OR AS A COMPLICATION OF MEDICATION<br/><br/>Delirium<br/><br/>Delirium often has multifactorial causation and manifests with an
acute presentation of disturbance in consciousness, change in cognition
and development of perceptual disturbances, with a fluctuating course.
(10) It may be due to the presence of CNS opportunistic infections,
metabolic disorders, neuropsychiatric side-effects of various drugs, or
substance intoxication or withdrawal. Studies from before the era of
highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) reported a prevalence of
delirium of 12-29% among individuals with AIDS. (11) The diagnosis of
delirium depends on accurate diagnosis of the underlying cause. A
comprehensive physical examination, diagnostic work-up (biochemical and
microbiological parameters, cerebrospinal fluid examination) and brain
imaging (computed tomography) are needed to help make the diagnosis.
Hospitalised patients with HIV should be assessed early and frequently
for delirium, and treatment for the underlying cause should be initiated
as soon as possible.<br/><br/>[FIGURE 2 OMITTED]<br/><br/>Substance intoxication or withdrawal<br/><br/>Substance intoxication and withdrawal are reversible
substance-specific syndromes and may present with a delirium-type
picture. HIV-infected individuals have a high prevalence of substance
abuse, with lifetime rates as high as 50%. (12) HIV-positive drug
abusers are reported to have higher rates of both HIV-associated
dementia and HIV encephy present with a delirium-type
picture. HIV-ialopathy than HIV-infected people who do not
abuse drugs. (13) Drug abuse may increase the risk of developing
delirium. Furthermore, it may not only affect disease progression but
also be associated with reduced adherence to antiretroviral therapy
(ART) and is therefore a very important co-morbidity to consider in the
patient with 'triple diagnosis' disorders, i.e. psychiatric
disorders, HIV infection and substance abuse disorders. (14)<br/><br/>Psychosis as a complication of medical treatment<br/><br/>Some medications used to treat HIV or the medical complications of
HIV/AIDS may cause psychiatric disorders presenting with psychotic
symptoms. Efavirenz has been associated with a wide range of
neuropsychiatric side-effects. Psychotic symptoms associated with the
commencement of efavirenz therapy are reported to occur early on and may
necessitate its discontinuation. (15)<br/><br/>Other medications commonly used in HIV medicine that can be
associated with mental state changes and psychotic symptoms include
corticosteroids; other antiviral agents, e.g. ganciclovir; antifungal
agents, e.g. amphotericin B; and some antibacterials, e.g.
anti-tuberculosis drugs, dapsone and sulphadiazines. (4,16)<br/><br/>These 'psychotoxic' reactions, which may manifest as
psychosis, mania or delirium, have been associated with the commencement
of treatment with isoniazid, ethionamide, ethambutol and some of the
fluoroquinolones. A study in Peru found that severe psychiatric
syndromes associated with isoniazid occurred in approximately 1% of
patients with tuberculosis between 1991 and 1999. (17) A careful history
is therefore necessary to determine the temporal relationship between
the development of psychotic symptoms and commencement of the drug, as
this has very important implications in terms of management.<br/><br/>TREATMENT OF HIV-ASSOCIATED PSYCHOSIS<br/><br/>When a patient presents with psychotic symptoms in the presence of
HIV infection it is essential to exclude life-threatening medical causes
of the psychotic symptoms. This may be extremely difficult in the
agitated, disorganised or violent patient, and antipsychotic medications
may need to be instituted before a thorough work-up is completed.
Antipsychotic medications are safe and effective in the presence of HIV
disease, but treatment modifications may be necessary and conservative
dosing strategies may need to be implemented. Antipsychotic medication
should always be used at the lowest possible dose for the shortest
possible duration.<br/><br/>[FIGURE 3 OMITTED]<br/><br/>The choice of antipsychotic drugs depends largely on the patient,
presenting symptoms, past response, potential side-effect profile,
possible drug interactions, cost, and pill burden of the chronically ill
patient. Many patients with new-onset psychosis or psychosis associated
with various medical conditions may only require short-term treatment
with antipsychotic medication. However, some patients may require
long-term maintenance treatment with antipsychotic agents, and here
special attention must be paid to the following factors. The typical
antipsychotics are commonly used in resource-constrained settings. Here
low doses of haloperidol (0.5-2.5 mg) and chlorpromazine (25-50 mg) have
proven effective and safe. Vigilance is required with regard to
extrapyramidal side-effects with haloperidol and anticholinergic
side-effects with chlorpromazine.<br/><br/>[FIGURE 4 OMITTED]<br/><br/>Among the atypical antipsychotics, risperidone (1-4 mg/d) is
commonly used, if available. This may be used in patients who present
with or pose a risk of developing extra-pyramidal side-effects. The
atypical antipsychotics are generally better tolerated than the typical
antipsychotics, but they are associated with longer-term metabolic
side-effects and the potential development of drug-drug interactions.
Development of the metabolic syndrome, weight gain, abnormal lipid
profiles and diabetes mellitus are well described with some of the
atypical antipsychotics (olanzapine and clozapine). The lipodystrophy
syndrome described in HIV-positive patients on ART predisposes these
patients to the development of diabetes mellitus and coronary artery
disease. The atypical antipsychotics with a propensity to develop
metabolic syndrome and certain ART regimens (protease inhibitors (PIs)
and the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in
particular), taken together, may have serious long-term adverse effects.
(18,19)<br/><br/>Many psychotropic medications and ART (especially the PIs and
NNRTIs) share the same cytochrome P450 (CYP) iso-enzymes for metabolism,
and competition between the two is prominent. (18,19) Interactions
resulting in a decreased plasma concentration-time curve for olanzapine
may be clinically important. (20) For other important interactions, see
the article in this issue on psychotropic prescribing.<br/><br/>It may be necessary to make use of benzodiazepines in the agitated,
aggressive patient when antipsychotics alone do not provide sufficient
containment. The use of benzodiazepines with few or no active
metabolites is crucial. Lorazepam in small divided doses may be
necessary, i.e. 1-2 mg orally every 8 hours. Caution is needed when
using lorazepam in the patient with delirium, as one study found it to
be ineffective and associated with significant adverse effects. (21)
However, this agent may be the only drug available in certain
resource-limited settings, and benefit versus risk will need to be
ascertained for each individual patient.<br/><br/>Psycho-education is imperative throughout all stages of treatment.
Psychosocial interventions and regular follow-up with the
multidisciplinary team (psychiatrist, psychiatric nurse, social worker,
occupational therapist and psychologist) are important. Adherence should
consistently be reinforced and improved. Referral to an occupational
therapist who uses various activity groups, support groups and food
garden/nutrition security groups to help improve adherence may be
considered. Supportive therapy is vitally important as the patient
recovers. Temporary placement in an appropriate facility may be
necessary for patients who are difficult to treat and those who require
longer in-patient care.<br/><br/>Ongoing viral replication in the brain is a risk factor for
neuropsychiatric disorders, and in combination with degree of
immunodeficiency and other factors that lower the threshold for
developing psychosis (family history, substance abuse) these constitute
a stress-within-a-stress diathesis model. It is often not realistic to
start ART in a psychotic patient without antipsychotics as adherence is
likely to be poor, but once the patient has reached a state of relative
stability ART should be started as soon as possible to decrease the
contribution of HIV replication in the brain. In patients with psychosis
related to immunosuppression and brain dysfunction, treatment with
antipsychotics and ART simultaneously may be necessary from the time of
initial presentation. It is vitally important that the patient be
monitored closely, either as an inpatient if difficult to contain, or
very closely by caregivers to ensure intensive adherence. Adherence
counselling at all stages of recovery is imperative to ensure
understanding of the need for ART and adherence to prevent possible
resistance.<br/><br/>It is difficult to recommend a time frame with regard to duration
of antipsychotic medication, as there is a relative paucity of
literature. A possible option is to wean the patient slowly off
antipsychotics after psychotic symptoms have remitted for 6 months, then
take a watch-and-wait approach. This must only be done if good follow-up
is possible so that antipsychotic medication can be reintroduced the
moment symptoms recur.<br/><br/>In order to simplify the management of psychosis in the
HIV-positive patient, three algorithms are presented. Fig. 2 describes
the management of psychotic disorders predating HIV infection, Fig. 3
details the treatment and referral procedure for new-onset psychosis,
and Fig. 4 describes the process for the assessment, management and
referral of psychosis associated with medical conditions, substance
intoxication/withdrawal and symptoms resulting from medication-related
side-effects.<br/><br/>COMMENCEMENT AND CHOICE OF ARV DRUGS FOLLOWING COMPREHENSIVE
WORK-UP AND REMISSION OF PSYCHOTIC SYMPTOMS<br/><br/>Commencement of ART may be initiated in accordance with the
Department of Health guidelines. (22) Department of Health first-line
regimens are used, but special attention needs to be paid to co-existing
antituberculosis treatment, liver toxicity, drug-drug interactions and
possible neuropsychiatric side-effects of various ARTs. Ideally
commencement of ART in the patient with psychosis should be instituted
in a multidisciplinary setting. Adherence is an important concern in
preparing patients for lifelong ART, but it is also crucial not to
exclude patients with serious mental illness from receiving ART because
they may 'possibly' be non-adherent. Involvement of a
treatment supporter is essential to assist with adherence, with the
patient's consent or assent. Intensive pretreatment education and
adherence counselling of the patient and treatment partner are vital in
order to assess treatment appropriateness and commitment to long-term
neuropsychiatric follow-up.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION<br/><br/>It is imperative to exclude an underlying medical cause for
psychotic symptoms in the HIV-infected patient, and a careful
differential diagnosis needs to be established based on the criteria set
out above. Psychotic symptoms respond well to antipsychotic medication,
but medication side-effects and drug-drug interactions must be
vigilantly watched out for. It is important to remember that patients
with mental illness are at an increased risk of being infected with HIV
