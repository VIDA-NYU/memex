			<p>Hard as it is to believe, the answer is true. </p>
			<p>World War I claimed an estimated 16 million lives. The influenza epidemic  that swept the world in 1918 killed an estimated 50 million people. One fifth of  the world's population was attacked by this deadly virus. Within months, it had  killed more people than any other illness in recorded history.</p>
			<p>The plague emerged in two phases. In late spring of 1918, the first phase,  known as the &quot;three-day fever,&quot; appeared without warning. Few deaths were  reported. Victims recovered after a few days. When the disease surfaced again  that fall, it was far more severe. Scientists, doctors, and health officials  could not identify this disease which was striking so fast and so viciously,  eluding treatment and defying control. Some victims died within hours of their  first symptoms. Others succumbed after a few days; their lungs filled with fluid  and they suffocated to death.</p>
			<p>The plague did not discriminate. It was rampant in urban and rural areas,  from the densely populated East coast to the remotest parts of Alaska. Young  adults, usually unaffected by these types of infectious diseases, were among the  hardest hit groups along with the elderly and young children. The flu afflicted  over 25 percent of the U.S. population. In one year, the average life expectancy  in the United States dropped by 12 years.</p>
			<p>It is an oddity of history that the influenza epidemic of 1918 has been  overlooked in the teaching of American history. Documentation of the disease is  ample, as shown in the records selected from the holdings of the National  Archives regional archives. Exhibiting these documents helps the epidemic take  its rightful place as a major disaster in world history.</p>
