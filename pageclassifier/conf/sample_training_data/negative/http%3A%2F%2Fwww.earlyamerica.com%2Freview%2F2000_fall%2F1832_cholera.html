          <font size="5">T</font>he study of history has long required the application 
          of sophisticated multi-causal analyses. Decades before "modern" 
          historians proposed a greater sensitivity and appreciation to environmental 
          factors and some aspects of environmental determinism, Frederick Jackson 
          Turner wrote of the "mastering" powers of nature, the environment, 
          and man's necessary adaptation to it. Turner's "Frontier Thesis" 
          proposed that it was the presence of vast frontier lands which caused 
          American history to be uniquely characterized by its individualism, 
          nationalism, sectionalism, and self-reliant unilateralism. Despite his 
          appreciation of the significance of the frontier's environment on history, 
          Turner, and many other historians have curiously overlooked the impact 
          and consequences of disease and pestilence upon American history preferring 
          to perceive the "germ theory" with a very different connotation,</font></p>

          influence of disease upon American history is an under appreciated historiographical 
          component. It is true that within the last few generations of American 
          historians, there has been a growing recognition that disease devastated 
          native American peoples prior to and after the arrival of Europeans 
          on the North American continent. But the influence of plagues, epidemics, 
          pestilences, and poxes upon local, regional, and national events has 
          been less studied. Relatively few historians, including European or 
          world historians such as Hans Zinnser and William H. McNeill, have proposed 
          environmentally oriented historiographical theories that highlight the 
          analysis of disease upon global history.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><sup>[iii]</sup></a> 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> <font size="5">I</font>n 
          his <u>Plagues and Peoples</u>, William H. McNeill recognized Turner's 
          contributions, but suggested that the "frontier" was a consequence 
          of cultural differentiation, which itself was the result of environmental 
          and geographical inequities. McNeill suggested that European's selective 
          disease immunities, post-Napoleonic political equilibrium, technological 
          changes, and a market oriented economy all propelled Western cultures 
          toward North America and other world wide frontier communities. McNeill's 
          global analysis synthesized an explanation for the existence of not 
          only North America frontier experiences, but also in other locations 
          at the forefront of European advancement. As McNeill suggests, the occurrence 
          of disease, epidemics, and pestilence constituted a persistent and expected 
          element of the "frontier experience." </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> <font size="5">T</font>he 
          response by several New York State communities to the 1832 invasion 
          of <i>Cholerae vibrio </i>provides an poignant opportunity to view man's 
          social and political adaptation to this component of his environment. 
          It is also a chance to understand another of William McNeill's biological/historical 
          theories: man and microbe are engaged in a long term relationship; disease, 
          pestilence, and plague are examples of microbial efforts to dominate 
          their frontier-<i>homo sapiens.</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> <font size="5">A</font>n 
          additional benefit from an analysis of the 1832 Cholera Pandemic is 
          that it illustrates the inextricability of regional, national and global 
          "great events" as a part of local history. Local historians 
          often do not give sufficient credit to their local events. Perhaps because 
          they are seen as too common and familiar, local historians tend to perceive 
          local history as less important, or that local history is only a part 
          of the "great' events occurring on a national or global scale. 
          It can be argued that it is actually the <i>local event</i>, particularly 
          in the case of epidemics-the case by case occurrence of disease, that 
          collectively creates "big history." </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> <font size="5">I</font>n 
          each of the individual community's reactions are elements of the greater 
          response by region, nations, and hemispheres to the global catastrophe 
          inherent in the 1832 Cholera Pandemic. Every response, whether it be 
          in (1) rural Otsego county, (2) the Village of Cooperstown, (3) Utica 
          or (4­) Buffalo, provides a glimpse into that community's values, culture, 
          and character. Each will also be compared to the response of the great 
          metropolis of New York City. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> <font size="5">E</font>ach 
          community's response usually included the creation of some sort of public 
          health response upon which later responses to other diseases and epidemics 
          would be based. In many ways the 1832 local health board's responses 
          to the Great Cholera Pandemic established the outlines of today's public 
          health reactions to all epidemics. </font></p>

          relatively scant historical acknowledgment, the periodic occurrence 
          of pestilences, diseases, and epidemics have long been a part of American 
          history. Almost as soon as the first Europeans arrived on the North 
          American continent, and centuries before the Cholera Pandemic of 1832, 
          American history was repeatedly afflicted with major and minor cycles

          had never appeared in North America or the western hemisphere prior 
          to Second Cholera Pandemic in 1832. Although it is sometimes exceedingly 
          difficult to determine if a prior illness and its symptoms constituted 
          a pa      had never appeared in North America or rticular disease, Cholera was probably first identified as a specific 
          illness in the late 1700's. By the early 19th century its symptoms and 
          peculiarities were well known and capable of differentiation from the 
          other great fevers: Yellow Fever or Typhoid. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> <font size="5">I</font>t 
          is generally acknowledged that cholera had long been endemic to the 
          Indian subcontinent and particularly to its northeast regions, the Ganges 
          Delta.<a

href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><sup>[vi]</sup></a> Medical historians 
          suggest the reporting of a similar disease in ancient historical accounts. 
          Historical reports from 1629 seem to describe a disease that at least 
          closely resembled cholera, and in the late 19th century, Indian travelers' 
          accounts appear to describe the classic conditions of cholera well prior 
          to the first Pandemic of 1817; over the next several years the disease 
          moved out of its historically affected region, and began a rapid and 
          progressively westward movement along and over the Arab-Moslem trade/travel 
          routes from India to the west extending to Muscat, the east coast of 
          Arabia, Syria, and southern Russia as far as the Volga River. As suddenly 
          as cholera had appeared, it abated by the early 1820's. This earliest 
          outbreak and its transition from endemic to epidemic to pandemic is 
          generally considered as the First Cholera Pandemic. Europe and the Americas 
          were unaffected by this first pandemic. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> <font size="5">U</font>nlike 
          other diseases that require human transportation, <i>Cholerae vibrio</i>, 
          can exist outside the human body.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><sup>[vii]</sup></a> 
          It is a bacterium and under the microscope it is shaped like a comma. 
          It only affects humans. Epidemiologists believe that it evolved in the 
          Ganges Delta region and until the modern era, was isolated to that area. 
          Until the arrival of Europeans and their technological transportation 
          inventions including railroads, steamships and canals, cholera had been 
          restricted to India.<a

href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><sup>[viii]</sup></a> For this reason, 
          Cholera has been called a "disease of the 19th century," and 
          the "Pandemic of the Industrial Revolution"; without modern 
          methods of transportation, it is unlikely to have become more than an 
          epidemic.<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><sup>[ix]</sup></a></font></p>
        <p> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i><font size="5">C</font>holerae 
          vibrio</i> can survive for surprisingly long periods of time in many 
          water sources including shallow wells, cisterns, or water storage tanks. 
          It does not require an intermediary animal host or some form of agent 
          (vector) for dispersal.<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><sup>[x]</sup></a> 
          Once ingested and if it can reach the human intestines, the bacteria 
          will there produce a toxin which inhibits the absorption of water and 
          salts. The bacteria then effectively flushes the intestines of any competition 
          and begins a massive replication of itself. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> <font size="5">C</font>holera's 
          physiological effects on humans are not appreciably different today 
          than in the 19th century. Individuals, then and now, were generally 
          unaware of their illness until a sudden onset of stomach cramps, nausea, 
          fever, and explosive-severe-voluminous diarrhea. Within hours of the 
          disease's onset, the cholera victim expelled immense quantities of bodily 
          fluids. Deprived of the body's necessary fluids, the cholera victim's 
          head, hands, and extremities turned cold, bluish in color, and death 
          like in touch. Death often occurred within hours of the first symptoms 
          and was generally "caused" by cardiac failure precipitated 
          by the severe electrolytic imbalances. It was an ugly, nasty, and repulsive 
          death. Individuals often lost consciousness and it was sometimes difficult 
          to determine if individual had actually expired. Medical records frequently 
          reported body "twitching" for hours after an individuals apparent 
          death. In response, many communities forbade burials sooner than 24 
          hours after death due to this phenomenon. </font></p>

          as suddenly as the First Cholera Pandemic abated in the early 1820's, 
          a new cholera cycle commenced in 1826, and soon affected all of India 
          and much of the Far East. In the West the disease traveled the familiar 
          trade routes into Afghanistan and into Russia by 1827.<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""><sup>[xiii]</sup></a> 
          By 1831 cholera had infected all of Russia's major cities despite quarantines 
          and sanitation measures. These defenses were ineffective primarily because 
          cholera victims invariably infected nearby water supplies, including 
          creeks, streams, and ultimately the major rivers. Russian troops carried 
          the disease into Poland in the winter of 1831. By June of that year, 
          it had arrived in Hungary, Austria, and Germany.<a href="#_edn14"

          English response to the 1832 Cholera Pandemic is historically significant. 
          In mid 1831 with cholera's "terror" loose on the continent 
          and approaching the British Isles, the government established a board 
          of health within the Royal College of Physicians. This Central Board 
          of Health was proclaimed in June of 1831 and consisted of seven physicians, 
          the comptroller of the navy, a deputy of the Board of Customs, director 
          general of the army's hospitals, and several other similarly important 
          officials. Among its first proposed recommendations, rules, and regulations, 
          applicable to each town and village, was "there should be established 
          a local Board of Health." Local boards were to consist of the local 
          chief magistrate and clergymen, one of whom, would serve as a correspondent 
          with London's Central Board of Health. Additionally, ". . .in each 
          town or its neighborhood," temporary hospitals were to be established 
          to which ". . .every case of the Disease as soon as detected . 
          . ." might be removed. Finally, "The Houses from which the 
          Sick Persons had been removed should be purified in the following manner. 
          The wearing apparel and household furniture should be thoroughly washing 
          and scoured, the walls and ceilings lime washed, the doors and windows

          New Yorkers observed from afar, the fearful and inexorable westward 
          movement of the cholera pandemic across Europe and into Great Britain, 
          the debate as to its causation and proper treatment escalated. Fundamental 
          to the entire discussion was the cultural non-cognizance that disease 
          originated in a micro-biological "germ theory" world. Rudimentary 
          modern concepts such as bacteria, toxins, personal cleanliness, and 
          public sanitation were either unknown and largely absent from the social 
          database. Quarantines were common and had been utilized for hundreds 
          of years, but the scientific idea of contagion was confused and interrelated 
          with religion, piety, sin, and "God's Justice."</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> <font size="5">I</font>n 
          all probability, most New Yorkers, if they had been asked in 1831-2 
          what they believed to have been cause of cholera, would have answered 
          that cholera/disease was some form of righteous consequence which afflicted 
          those who were least likely to be in God's grace. As further proof they 
          would cite that Cholera most often affected those persons who lived 
          dissolute, alcoholic, drug related, sexually excessive, and filth ridden 
          lives; cholera's victims were simply being punished by God. It was the 
          consequence of sin and "was the inevitable and inescapable judgment" 
          of the Divine Power. "Cholera was a scourge not of mankind but 
          of the sinner."<a href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24"
title=""><sup>[xxiv]</sup></a> And, it was a known and seemingly irrefutable fact 
          that cholera was most commonly found in those areas of the world least

          contrast to the simple purity of Christianity's rationale for cholera, 
          medicine, physicians, and other adherents of "reason," proposed 
          theories which also recognized that certain social groups seemed more 
          vulnerable. Similar to those who considered cholera the product of sin, 
          knowledgeable and scientific people agreed that it was the imprudent, 
          the dirty, and the intemperate who were more subject to cholera's terror. 
          Instead of God's punishment, they proposed that cholera was "an 
          influence in the atmosphere," a miasma (poison) that afflicted 
          only those who had weakened themselves by exposure to certain behaviors, 
          places, or "exciting causes." <a href="#_edn25"
name="_ednref25" title=""><sup>[xxv]</sup></a> Only those persons of irregular 
          habits should fear cholera. The good, the clean, and the temperate would

          this more rationale theory was the long standing debate between the 
          rival schools of thoughts regarding epidemics: Contagionism or Miasmatism. 
          Many men and women of "reason" had long proposed that epidemics 
          only occurred as the result of a miasma in the atmosphere which if encountered 
          by a weakened individual caused disease. This theory suggested that 
          the miasmatic atmospheric phenomenon was generated by rotting corpses, 
          marshy land areas, and other putrescent matter exhaling vaporous emanations.

          rival theory, contagionism, was a precursor of the germ theory which 
          would not be discovered until much later in the 19th century. In 1832, 
          without an understanding of either microbiology or germ theory, its 
          adherents were hard pressed and relatively few. Quarantines were the 
          natural product of the contagion concept, but confusingly, many diseases 
          including cholera seemed transmittable without direct personal contact. 
          It would not be until the Third Cholera Pandemic of 1849, through the 
          efforts of an obscure London scientist/doctor, John Snow, and his observations 
          of cholera victims and their water sources, that the rudiments of a 
          germ theory would be understood.<a href="#_edn27"

          with the discoveries of Louis Pasteur, and the 1882 identification of

          be rejected.<a href="#_edn28"

          complicating an understanding of New Yorker's and American attitudes 
          regarding the causation of cholera was a collection of other attitudes, 
          prejudices, and philosophies characteristic of 19th century America. 
          Social reformers, such as New York's George Henry Evans, perceived cholera 
          not as God's retribution for sin, but rather as proof of man's inhumanity 
          to man. Cholera was overwhelmingly a "poor man's plague," 
          and the reason for that was rooted in America's underlying unjust social 
          and economic systems. Social radicals were aware and incensed that on 
          one day in July of 1832, over 100 persons died of cholera in New York 
          City. Of that group, 95 were buried in the city's graveyard for the 
          poor-Potter's Field.<a href="#_edn29"

        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> <font size="5">O</font>thers 
          within American society saw cholera's causation as based in the unchecked 
          immigration into the United States of foreign born persons-especially 
          the Roman Catholic Irish. And of course, it was true that the Irish 
          died in inordinate numbers during the 1832 epidemic. As the newest and 
          the poorest immigrants, the Irish lived in the worst housing, under 
          the most crowded circumstances, and were least able to afford good water, 
          medical care, or flight from the epidemic.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> <font size="5">L</font>ast 
          and certainly not the least in historical significance, is that some 
          Americans perceived that cholera's causation and occurrence was further 
          proof that African-Americans were foreordained to suffer due to their 
          social and genetic inferiority. As one might expect from their endemic 
          poverty, African-Americans died during the 1832 cholera epidemic at 
          significantly higher rates compared to those of whites. </font></p>

          cholera was received as proof, indeed as justification of their ideas.

          nearly thirty years before Snow's, Pasteur's, and Koch's establishment 
          of a "germ theory," Coventry's discussion of causation, and 
          recommendations for treatment, are painful and uncomfortable to read. 
          The ignorance of the underlying biology, microbiology, and "germ 
          theory" causation of cholera combined with its suggested treatments 
          provoke enormous empathy for cholera's helpless victims. Without exaggeration,

          Coventry's treatise established, 19th century medical treatments for 
          cholera were ultimately grounded in the tenet that "the disease 
          may be properly be divided into four stages:" (1) Premonitory, 
          (2) Cramps, diarrhea, and coldness, (3) Collapse, and (4) Consecutive

          with other non-medical, homeopathic, naturalist, or simple "medical

          each of the identified four (4) individual stages, unique medicines 
          and treatments were prescribed. Complicating the entire diagnosis and 
          treatment process was the reality that 19th century physicians could 
          not effectively differentiate between a myriad of similar illnesses. 
          An upset stomach, food poisoning, common diarrhea, and dysentery were 
          all considered more or less related to the 1832 Cholera. These lesser 
          forms were typically denominated as <i>Cholera morbus</i> and lumped 
          together with the more aggravated form which was usually denoted as

          physicians felt that cholera was particularly susceptible to medical 
          management during its Premonitory stage. The onset of lesser stomach 
          spasms and "painless" diarrhea was considered not part of 
          the disease but a precursor; if prompt medical attention were received, 
          individuals could escape, prevent, or otherwise avoid the disease. It 
          was "not improperly termed the curable stage."<a href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34" title=""><sup>[xxxiv]</sup></a> 
          The Premonitory stage, and the medical community's fixation that it 
          could be managed, was erroneous. The "curable stage" was simply 
          one of the many common "stomach upsets" other than cholera. 
          The conclusion that cholera was curable was based upon a faulty premise: 
          all similar symptoms are the same disease and were related.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> <font size="5">T</font>reatment 
          of the first stage (Premonitory) of cholera consisted of confining the 
          victim to bed and the taking of some warmed mild aromatic drink such 
          as spearmint, chamomile, or warm camphor julep. Once the individual 
          had commenced to perspire, calomel, camphor, magnesia, and pure castor 
          oil was administered.<a href="#_edn35" name="_ednref35" title=""><sup>[xxxv]</sup></a> 
          If the cholera victim had recently consumed food, an emetic such as 
          ipecacuanha or sulfate of zinc was given. It was also recommended that 
          bleeding of the victim be performed. "The object of the bleeding 
          is to relieve the internal congestion," and should be discontinued 
          if the victim faints.<a href="#_edn36" name="_ednref36" title=""><sup>[xxxvi]</sup></a></font></p>

          the second stage, which 19th century medical professionals considered 
          the actual onset of cholera, treatments were intensified. During this 
          stage, as cholera's victims suffered excruciating nausea, massive diarrhea, 
          cramps, physical collapse, cold clammy extremities, and a feeble pulse, 
          medical therapies included, "put the feet and legs in water as 
          warm as could be born, with the addition of mustard and common salt 
          to the water; open a vein in the arm, and bleed from five, to sixteen 
          to twenty ounces . . apply a large mustard cataplasm over the stomach 
          and give . . .calomel, opium, an camphor, every half hour." If 
          the patient continued to deteriorate, and was there any reason to think 
          he would not, "Sulphuric ether in small doses should be given . 
          . .at the same time an enema of a pint of chicken tea, with a table 
          spoonful of salt . . .should be thrown into the bowels . . ."<a href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37" title=""><sup>[xxxvii]</sup></a></font></p>

          persons survived cholera's third stage which was sometimes called the 
          "stage of asphyxia." The principle of treatment during this 
          portion of the illness was to "arouse the dormant energies of the 
          system." Larger doses of calomel and camphor were recommended; 
          in addition, quinine and morphine were to be administered every half 
          hour, and "a cholera patient . . . should never be left a moment 
          without the presence of an intelligent nurse."<a href="#_edn38" name="_ednref38" title=""><sup>[xxxviii]</sup></a></font></p>

          the patient survived the treatments prescribed for the third stage, 
          further bleeding or the attachment of leeches was recommended for the 
          fourth stage. More calomel, magnesia, camphor, opium, and morphine pills 
          were given, and if during this stage of cholera, "consecutive fever" 
          or typhoid appeared, "it may be necessary to resort to tonics and 
          stimulants such as sul. quinine, serpentaria, carb. of ammonia, wine 
          whey, oil of turpentine, etc."<a href="#_edn39" name="_ednref39" title=""><sup>[xxxix]</sup></a>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> <font size="5">V</font>ariations 
          upon these therapies were as numerous as there were physicians. Some 
          treatments emphasized exterior stimulants to the system, in hopes of 
          energizing the collapsing patient, by rubbing the victim's body with 
          rebefacients, the most common being combinations of mustard, oils of 
          turpentine, and cayenne pepper.<a href="#_edn40" name="_ednref40" title=""><sup>[xl]</sup></a> 
          Other physicians routinely recommended immense dosages of calomel, a 
          chalky mercury compound, until the victim's gums stared bleeding. The 
          most common, and considered as conservative therapies, always included 
          some combination of calomel, opium (laudanum), and bleedings. </font></p>

          exotic and radical treatments abounded: tobacco smoke enemas, electric

          ignorance of an epidemic's etiology and the politicization of its inherent 
          public health issues, is not a deficiency limited to the twentieth century. 
          While cholera ravaged Europe and seemed inevitably destined to emigrate 
          to North America, New Yorkers, both City and State, were engaged in 
          a curious debate. Those few in number who believed in cholera's Contagionism 
          clamored for the imposition of quarantines of people, goods, and products 
          arriving at New York's harbors and borders. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> <font size="5">T</font>he 
          predominant view, Miasmatism, resorted to non-medical arguments against 
          quarantines. They argued that the establishment of quarantines would 
          not contribute to the battle against cholera, but would simply promote 
          "vulgar prejudices." Quarantines were additionally considered 
          contrary to "liberty," and were the "engines of oppression, 
          despotism, and bureaucracy."<a

          medical community arguments regarding the nature of cholera, quarantines

          cholera had successfully emigrated to North America.</font></p>

          is historically interesting of how and where cholera first appeared 
          in New York City and State. Many had predicted and prayed that the Atlantic 
          Ocean would successfully prevent cholera from emigrating to the New 
          World. Those expectations were dashed when cholera reports from Albany 
          indicated the epidemic was present in Montreal and Quebec. Contemporary 
          histories suggested that cholera first appeared in Montreal on June 
          6, 1832 amongst Irish immigrants and moved rapidly down the Champlain 
          Valley into the Hudson Valley. By June 14th cholera was at Whitehall, 
          and by the 18th it was in Mechanicsville just north of Albany. Cholera's 
          second invasion route into New York was up the St. Lawrence and along 
          the shores of Lake Ontario. A probable third method was the direct entry 
          of immigrants into the port of New York. </font></p>

          was already feeling better, but his two children were sick . . .The 
          children died on Wednesday, but not before they were seen by many physicians,

          half century later in the 1870's, hearsay evidence surfaced which suggested 
          that prior to the outbreak in Montreal, cholera had arrived in the Port 
          of New York aboard immigrant ships. The sick had been quarantined onboard; 
          those who were not sick were released and shipped away from the city. 
          At least one source has suggested cholera was present in New York at 
          an early date in June but the fact of its existence suppressed by the

          before cholera's June 1832 arrival in New York City, a Board of Health 
          existed as the result of the City's many experiences with prior epidemics. 
          Throughout the eighteenth century, New York City had been repeatedly 
          afflicted with many diseases including yellow fever, smallpox, measles, 
          and diphtheria.<a

href="#_edn48" name="_ednref48" title=""><sup>[xlviii]</sup></a> Despite the establishment 
          of a Board of Health, it should not be assumed that government typically 
          played a dominant role in prior epidemics. Private individuals, groups, 
          and charitable associations had long dominated the "public health" 
          response to prior diseases. The 1832 Cholera epidemic would prove to 
          be noticeably different.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> <font size="5">I</font>n 
          September of 1831, as the City prepared for the anticipated arrival 
          of cholera, the Board (the Mayor, Aldermen, and City Recorder) established 
          a committee to gather information regarding the European epidemic; it 
          also, along with the Health Officer appointed by the state, enforced 
          an initial quarantine issued by the Mayor during the winter of 1831-32.<a href="#_edn49" name="_ednref49" title=""><sup>[xlix]</sup></a>

          persons were highly critical of New York City's lack of cholera epidemic 
          preparation. In early June of 1832, and in response to the public criticism, 
          Mayor Walter Browne expanded the quarantine to against all peoples and 
          products of Europe and Asia. Eventually the quarantine prohibited ships 
          from approaching closer than 300 yards to the city; vehicles were ordered 
          to stop 1.5 miles away. On June 4th a city ordinance was introduced 
          promoting the cleaning of New York's legendary filthy streets; passed 
          on June 13, the ordinance substantially reorganized New York's sanitation 
          departments.<a href="#_edn50"

          days after the outbreak of cholera in June of 1832, the NYC Board of 
          Health was overwhelmed by public hysteria and the myriad details of 
          the epidemic's administration. In response to the crisis, the Board, 
          without a real legal foundation, created a Special Medical Council and 
          three man "executive committees," staffed by several prominent 
          physicians/citizens. Much of the city's subsequent administration of 
          its varied programs was overseen by these smaller "crisis management" 
          committees.<a

href="#_edn51" name="_ednref51" title=""><sup>[li]</sup></a> In this respect, 
          the 1832 Cholera epidemic was different than prior diseases and epidemics; 
          instead of government's prior tendency to disintegrate and disappear 
          as disease approached, the New York City government remained on the 
          field and played a major and dominant role in the public health response.<a href="#_edn52" name="_ednref52" title=""><sup>[lii]</sup></a> 
          Perhaps it was a mistaken reliance upon the prevalent medical delusion 
          that cholera would affect only the intemperate or imprudent, but the 
          result was a governmental public health response unlike any earlier 
          effort.</font></p>

          its tardy start, the NYC Board of Health and its associated committees, 
          did take several reasonably decisive actions regarding the management 
          of cholera. On June 17 the City approved the erection of several (5) 
          temporary hospitals (not including the Bellevue almshouse) at various 
          locations within the city. $25,000 was appropriated for their establishment 
          and staffing; old banks, abandoned buildings, former schoolhouses, and 
          at least one public building were converted to special "cholera 
          hospitals."<a

        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> <font size="5">I</font>n 
          addition to the establishment of hospitals, the City also created primitive 
          welfare services, slum clearance programs, food and drug regulations, 
          and the suppression of unsanitary nuisances. Streets, which had never 
          been cleaned of the accumulation of several decades of excrement, dead 
          animals, garbage, and other waste, were shoveled, swept, cleaned and 
          covered with tons of chloride of lime (quicklime). The City's <i>worst</i> 
          slums were evacuated. These newly indigent and homeless persons required 
          the immediate rental of several buildings as well as supplies of food, 
          clothing, and drugs. Temporary housings or shanties were erected in 
          several places within the city.<a href="#_edn54" name="_ednref54" title=""><sup>[liv]</sup></a></font></p>

          Private persons, charitable associations, and churches established soup 
          kitchens, paid the poor to clean streets, "purify" their own

          to the municipal government's response, many of the city's residents 
          reacted less admirably but historically consistent with prior public 
          responses to epidemics. New York was not a huge city in 1832. Of its 
          250,000 residents, it is estimated that as many as a third (80,000) 
          fled to the country where they thought the chances of epidemic were

          of miles north-west from New York City, and in a community a fraction 
          of its size, the threat of cholera terrorized Buffalo, New York. By 
          the time most New Yorkers had learned of the early June presence of 
          cholera in Montreal, the disease had already commenced its movement

          with unusual alacrity, New York Governor Enos Throop called a special 
          session of the Legislature for June 21, 1832. A "Public Health 
          Act" was speedily passed by both Houses of the State Legislature 
          and signed by the Governor within two days. In addition to a strict 
          quarantine along the Upper and Lower New York-Canadian frontier, it 
          also ordered the many communities along the St. Lawrence, Hudson, Lake 
          Ontario, Lake Erie, Lake Champlain, and Erie Canal to appoint local 
          public health boards. <a href="#_edn60" name="_ednref60" title=""><sup>[lx]</sup></a> 
          It also empowered each of the State's cities and villages, not having 
          a local health board to establish one. Over the next several weeks, 
          communities all over New York established local boards of public health. 
          "Usually manned by the overseers of the poor and other local officials" 
          they were to serve as the shock troops in the ensuing battle against 
          the cholera epidemic. </font></p>

          Roswell Haskins, Dyre Tillinghast, and Lewis F. Allen were appointed 
          and supervised by the Mayor, Dr. Ebenezer Johnson. Loring Pierce was

          hospital in "The McHose House," located in a hollow between 
          Niagara and Ninth Street. Steamboats were stopped until medical inspections 
          of everyone aboard had occurred; stage coaches were halted at the edge 
          of the city. Canal boats were met and inspected while "country 
          people were kept at a safe distance outside by their own fears of the 
          contagion." Everyone heeded to a variety of food and drug <i>nostrums</i>

          upon another of cholera's water invasion routes, New York's highly successful 
          Erie Canal, Utica's 1832 cholera experience was similar to that of other 
          Canal situated communities. During the early summer of 1832, Utica's 
          newspapers indicate a dynamic and vibrant city deeply involved in the 
          local, regional, and national political-economic events of 1832. Andrew 
          Jackson's veto of the bill re-chartering the National Bank created great 
          interest. Substantial sectional controversy existed regarding the 1832 
          Tariff; Senator Henry Clay was expected to lead the anti-Jackson campaign 
          in the Presidential elections. But it was the dreaded approach and terror 
          of cholera which truly dominated the news.<a href="#_edn65"

          to Buffalo's actions, and apparently in anticipation to the June 21, 
          1832 "Public Health Law," Utica's Common Council established 
          a local Board of Health with the appointments of Doctors Goodsell, McCall, 
          Coventry, Peckham, and McCraith on June 18, 1832. In addition and at 
          the same meeting, the Council granted Thomas Brennon's petition as City 
          Scavenger for additional compensation. </font></p>

          the next several weeks (June-July), Utica newspapers indicated several 
          deaths without a medical causation listed. It is entirely possible that 
          the cause of death was other than cholera but it is historically suspicious 
          and likely that these late June and early July deaths may have been 
          cholera related. At the same time, the Common Council approved (1) pay 
          raises for additional scavengers, (2) petitions for temporary hospital, 
          and (3) reviewed prosecutions by the City Attorney against individuals 
          for the maintenance of nuisances on their premises.<a href="#_edn66" name="_ednref66" title=""><sup>[lxvi]</sup></a>

          cholera epidemic was slightly slower to appear in the interior of New 
          York, and did not fully envelop Utica until late July and early August 
          of 1832. Prior to August 14th, the cause for each death was treated 
          circumspectly. Such discretion was justified due to the tendency to 
          associate cholera with the "intemperate and imprudent." With 
          the early August deaths of Philo Rockwell, Esq., Clara Ostrom, daughter 
          of David Ostrom, Esq, and sister of General John H. Ostrom, and Miss 
          Gainer, daughter of Mr. William Gainer, "cholera" was definitively 
          and publicly acknowledged as the cause of death. Over the next several 
          weeks between August-September 1832, nearly a hundred obituary notices 
          were published in Utica newspapers with the vast majority attributed 
          to "death due to cholera."<a href="#_edn67" name="_ednref67"

          Boards of Health had been armed with significant authority and power 
          by the June 21, 1832 "Public Health Law." In Utica a local 
          controversy erupted on August 15 amongst medical members of the board 
          and its other members. Doctors Goodwell, Coventry, Peckham, and McCraith 
          resigned as a result of the Boards "interference with their professional 
          duties." New members were immediately appointed including several 
          well known personages: Ezra S. Cozier, William Williams, J.E. Bloomfield, 
          Alfred Munson, Spencer Kellog, and Samuel Beardsley.</font></p>

          New York City's municipal finances, the maintenance and popularity of 
          the Board of Health and Utica's temporary hospital during the epidemic 
          was also a matter of some public controversy. Petitions to the Utica 
          Common Council for articles furnished, lumber procured, payment for 
          drugs, clothes, and providing work for the local destitute were staggering 
          to a small community. The uncertainty of cholera's causation, its social 
          and personal costs, and the care received at the community hospital 
          by Utica's cholera victims eventually caused a mob of Utica Irish workmen 
          to riot and attack the facility in the late summer.<a href="#_edn68" name="_ednref68" title=""><sup>[lxviii]</sup></a></font></p>

          presence of cholera precipitated great anxiety in individuals and within 
          communities. Surviving letters from persons residing near Utica depict 
          the social and personal anxiety, fear, and terror felt by New Yorkers 
          during the summer of 1832. In a letter dated mid July from Utica's Mary 
          and O. Williams to their son Othniel Williams in Salem, Massachusetts,

          abruptly as the 1832 Second Cholera Pandemic appeared in New York, it 
          dissipated and disappeared by December of the same year. It is unclear 
          why it ended so abruptly. Perhaps it was the dispersal of people as 
          they fled from New York, Buffalo, or Utica; or maybe it was a subtle 
          change in New York's summer climate that changed the disease's life 
          cycle. Some have suggested that despite the confusion propounded by 
          the Miasmatics, the Contagionists and their "obsolete" quarantine 
          theories were actually able to affect the disease's movement. The answer 
          is unknown.</font></p>

          similar epidemic, the Third Cholera Pandemic, returned to the United 
          States in 1849. It is believed that over 150,000 Americans died during 
          the two pandemics. Another 50,000 died in the Fourth Pandemic of 1866.<a href="#_edn75"

          world is presently engaged in the Seventh Cholera Pandemic. In June 
          of 1997, The World Health Organization announced that more cases of 
          cholera had been reported in the 1990's than in any other decade since 
          official reporting had started. Despite world-wide public health efforts, 
          cholera is in its Seventh Cholera Pandemic and has caused millions of 
          cases and tens of thousands of deaths. </font></p>

          America, which had been free of cholera for over 100 years, has suffered 
          over 1,400,000 reported cases of cholera since 1990. In Asia, a new 
          and more drug resistant strain of <i>Cholerae vibrio</i> emerged and 
          caused over 200,000 cases in India, Bangladesh, and the other nations 
          of South East Asia. In 1996, cholera was responsible for more than 200,000 
          cases and many thousands of deaths.<a href="#_edn76" name="_ednref76"

          in New York's experience in the 1832 cholera epidemic, we can expect 
          that the historical consequences of the Seventh Cholera Pandemic will 
          be profound and yet, curiously underappreciated. Cholera in particular 
          remains an unpopular, "dirty" event and is overwhelmingly 
          associated with filth, ignorance, poverty, contaminated water, lack 
          of public health, and newly developing communities. It was, and is, 
          a disease of the Industrial Revolution. The processes which permitted 
          the shift from endemic, to epidemic, and finally to pandemic (trains, 
          canals, steamboats) are also the product of a society shifting from 
          isolation and third world living conditions, to exposure and engagement 
          in world-wide higher standards of trade and travel. The same historical/scientific 
          process which allowed cholera to become an epidemic (Age of Enlightenment, 
          science, reason, Industrial Revolution, and medicine) eventually resulted 
          in its control by Europeans and Americans. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> <font size="5">M</font>any 
          other social, medical, and historical consequences of the 1832 Cholera 
          Epidemic are also underappreciated. Without the establishment and efforts 
          of the many hundreds of local boards of health in 1832, the later advancement 
          of public health organizations in the 19th century would have been slower. 
          The idea of protecting a community water's supplies, if only of not 
          disposing of dead animals within it, was of great significance. The 
          sharing of information by physicians; or the publication of medical 
          case histories in New York City's <i>Cholera Bulletin</i> was of profound 
          importance in the advancement of public health.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> <font size="5">O</font>f 
          course, the enhancement of one idea often witnesses the subsidence of 
          another. Miasmatism, which had been on the increase, was reconsidered. 
          At the occurrence of the Fourth Epidemic, Snow's theories relating to 
          London's water supplies, were seriously considered. But it started with 
          the suggestion that community's should protect their water supplies.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> <font size="5">O</font>n 
          another scale, the 1832 Cholera Epidemic also played a part in the further 
          enhancement of "reason and science" as opposed to spirituality 
          and the idea that cholera was God's retribution for sin. If the good, 
          the temperate, and the prudent were struck down by cholera, perhaps 
          it was not God's will after all but something else. And of course, once 
          the question, "what could that cause be?" was asked, the rest 
          is history.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> <font size="5">T</font>he 
          1832 Cholera Epidemic was also part of the 19th century process which 
          resulted in the concentration of governmental power at state levels. 
          Public health administration by its very nature results in the centralization 
          of governmental. Without New York's June 21, 1832 "Public Health 
          Law," it is doubtful if many local boards of health and their application 
          of state-wide standards would ever have occurred. Modern public health 
          administration is also characterized by the shift from local volunteers 
          to state professionals.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> <font size="5">A</font>s 
          can be observed, the consequences of the 1832 Cholera Epidemic in New 
          York State and its myriad individual, social, medical, and political 
          significance are multi-level in its causality. Yet, and most curiously 
          unappreciated of all, is the simple idea that disease is of elemental 
          importance to historiography. In the twentieth century, historians have 
          witnessed the trivialization of history in many ways. Analyses which 
          attribute social, political, and economic causation have been denigrated 
          by frivolous politically motivated agendas. The influence of disease 
          upon history should be understood as fundamental to historiography. 
          It is as essential a part of understanding the "frontier," 
          as it is in understanding the most current "environmental historiography" 
          of the late twentieth century. As the American historian Carl Becker 
          said, "In the history of history a myth is a once valid but now 
          discarded version of the human story, as our now valid versions will 
          in due course be relegated to the category of discarded myths."<a href="#_edn77"

          hisory then The Cholera Epidemic of 1832 and its influence upon history
