The plague held a massive mortality rate between 30 and 40%. Victims had no idea what had caused the disease. Neither did the physicians in the Middle Ages. The most that could be done was that various concoctions of herbs might be administered to relieve the symptoms - there was no known cure. Headaches were relieved by rose, lavender, sage and bay. Sickness or nausea was treated with wormwood, mint, and balm. Lung problems were treated with liquorice and comfrey. Vinegar was used as a cleansing agent as it was believed that it would kill disease. But bloodletting was commonly thought to be one of the best ways to treat the plague.

Bristol was an important European port and city in England during the Medieval era. It is widely believed that Bristol was the place where the Black Death first reached England. The plague reached England during the summer months between June and August. The Back Death reached London by 1st November 1348. London was a crowded, bustling city with a population of around 70,000. The sanitation in London was poor and living conditions were filthy. The River Thames brought more ships and infection to London which spread to the rest of England. The crowded, dirty living conditions of the English cities led to the rapid spread of the disease. Church records that the actual deaths in London were approximately 20,000. Between 1348 and 1350, killed about 30 - 40% of the population of England which at the time was estimated to be about five to six million. Many people were thrown into open communal pits. The oldest, youngest and poorest died first. Whole villages and towns in England simply ceased to exist after the Black Death.</b></font></p><p align="center"><font color="#666633"><b><a href="http://www.william-shakespeare.info/bubonic-black-plague-elizabethan-era.htm">Black Death during the Elizabethan Era</a></b></font></p><p align="justify"><font size="4" color="#702810"><b>The Black Death Victims in the Middle Ages - The daughter of the King of England</b></font><font color="#666633"><b><br>The Black Death struck people and took its victims from all walks of society. <a href="king-edward-iii.htm">King Edward III</a> (1312 � 1377) was King of England during the terrible period of the plague. Edward had arranged a marriage for his&nbsp; favourite daughter Joan Plantagenet. Joan was born in February 1335 in Woodstock. Joan was to marry King Pedro of Castille, the son of Alfonso XI and Maria of Portugal. The marriage was to take place in Castille. Joan (sometimes referred to as Joanna ) left England with the blessing of her parents. The Black Death had not yet taken its hold in England and its first victims had only been claimed in France in August 1348. Joan travelled through France and contracted the deadly disease.

The spread of the deadly plag was almost 50% in isolated populations such as monasteries. There were not enough clergy to offer the last rites or give support and help to the victims. The situation was so bad that Pope Clement VI was forced to grant remission of sins to all who died of the Black Death. Victims were allowed to confess their sins to one another, or &quot;even to a woman&quot;. The church could offer no reason for the deadly disease and beliefs were sorely tested.
