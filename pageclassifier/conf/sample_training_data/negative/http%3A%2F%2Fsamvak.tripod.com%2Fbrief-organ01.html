<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>A kidney fetches $2700 in Turkey and up to
$4000 in the Philippines. Another $6,000-12,000 go to various intermediaries.
According to the October 2002 issue of the Journal of the American Medical
Association, this is a high price. An Indian or Iraqi kidney enriches its
former owner by a mere $1000. Wealthy clients later pay for the rare organ up
to $150,000.<br>
<br>
CBS News aired, five years ago, a documentary, filmed by Antenna 3 of Spain, in
which undercover reporters in Mexico were asked, by a priest acting as a
middleman for a doctor, to pay close to 1 million dollars for a single kidney.
An auction of a human kidney on eBay in February 2000 drew a bid of $100,000
before the company put a stop to it. Another auction in September 1999 drew
$5.7 million - though, probably, merely as a prank.<br>
<br>
Organ harvesting operations flourish in Asia (in the Philippines, where it was
briefly legal in 2007-8), in Turkey and Iran, in central Europe, mainly in the
Czech Republic, and in the Caucasus, mainly in Georgia. Penumbral middlemen and
surgeons operate on Turkish, Moldovan, Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian,
Romanian, Bosnian, Kosovar, Macedonian, Albanian and assorted east European
donors.<br>
<br>
They remove kidneys, lungs, pieces of liver, even corneas, bones, tendons,
heart valves, skin and other sellable human bits. The organs are kept in cold
storage and air lifted to illegal distribution centers in the United States,
Germany, Scandinavia, the United Kingdom, Israel, South Africa, and other rich,
industrialized locales. It gives &quot;brain drain&quot; a new, spine chilling,
meaning.<br>
<br>
Organ trafficking has become an international trade. It involves Indian, Thai,
Philippine, Brazilian, Turkish and Israeli doctors who scour the Balkan and
other destitute regions for tissues. The Washington Post reported, in Novembermeaning.<br>
<br>
Organ trafficking has become an international trade. It involves Indian, Thai,
Philippine, Brazilian, Turkish and Israeli doctors who scour the Balkan and
other destitute regions fo
2002, that in a single village in Moldova, 14 out of 40 men were reduced by
penury to selling body parts. In the Philippines, in �one-kidney island�, there
are well over 3000 donors.<br>
<br>
Four years ago, Moldova cut off the thriving baby adoption trade due to an - an
unfounded - fear the toddlers were being dissected for spare organs. According
to the Israeli daily, Ha'aretz, the Romanians are investigating similar
allegations in Israel and have withheld permission to adopt Romanian babies
from dozens of eager and out of pocket couples. American authorities are
scrutinizing a two year old Moldovan harvesting operation based in the United
States.<br>
<br>
Organ theft and trading in Ukraine is a smooth operation. According to news
agencies, in August 2002, three Ukrainian doctors were charged in Lvov with
trafficking in the organs of victims of road accidents. The doctors used
helicopters to ferry kidneys and livers to colluding hospitals. They charged up
to $19,000 per organ.<br>
<br>
The West Australian daily surveyed in January 2002 the thriving organs business
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Sellers are offering their wares openly, through
newspaper ads. Prices reach up to $68,000. Compared to an average monthly wage
of less than $200, this is an unimaginable fortune.<br>
<br>
National health insurance schemes turn a blind eye. Israel's participates in
the costs of purchasing organs abroad, though only subject to rigorous vetting
of the sources of the donation. Still, a May 2001 article in a the New York
Times Magazine, quotes &quot;the coordinator of kidney transplantation at
Hadassah University Hospital in Jerusalem (as saying that) 60 of the 244
patients currently receiving post-transplant care purchased their new kidney
from a stranger - just short of 25 percent of the patients at one of Israel's
largest medical centers participating in the organ business&quot;.<br>
<br>
Many Israelis - attempting to avoid scrutiny - travel to east Europe,
accompanied by Israeli doctors, to perform the transplantation surgery. These
junkets are euphemistically known as &quot;transplant tourism&quot;. Clinics
have sprouted all over the benighted region. Israeli doctors have recently
visited impoverished Macedonia, Bulgaria, Kosovo and Yugoslavia to discuss with
local businessmen and doctors the setting up of kidney transplant clinics.<br>
<br>
Such open involvement in what can be charitably described as a latter day slave
trade gives rise to a new wave of thinly disguised anti-Semitism. The Ukrainian
Echo, quoting the Ukrinform news agency, reported, on January 7, 2002, that,
implausibly, a Ukrainian guest worker died in Tel-Aviv in mysterious
circumstances and his heart was removed. The Interpol, according to the paper,
is investigating this lurid affair.<br>
<br>
According to scholars, reports of organ thefts and related abductions, mainly
of children, have been rife in Poland and Russia at least since 1991. The
buyers are supposed to be rich Arabs.<br>
<br>
Nancy Scheper-Hughes, an anthropologist at the University of California at
Berkeley and co-founder of Organs Watch, a research and documentation center,
is also a member and co-author of the Bellagio Task Force Report on
Transplantation, Bodily Integrity and the International Traffic in Organs. In a
report presented in June 2001 to the House Subcommittee on International
Operations and Human Rights, she substantiated at least the nationality of the
alleged buyers, though not the urban legends regarding organ theft:<br>
<br>
&quot;In the Middle East residents of the Gulf States (Kuwait, Saudi Arabia,
and Oman) have for many years traveled to India, the Philippines, and to
Eastern Europe to purchase kidneys made scarce locally due to local
fundamentalist Islamic teachings that allow organ transplantation (to save a
life), but prohibit organ harvesting from brain-dead bodies.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, hundreds of kidney patients from Israel, which has its own well
-developed, but under-used transplantation centers (due to ultra-orthodox
Jewish reservations about brain death) travel in 'transplant tourist' junkets
to Turkey, Moldova, Romania where desperate kidney sellers can be found, and to
Russia where an excess of lucrative cadaveric organs are produced due to lax
standards for designating brain death, and to South Africa where the amenities
in transplantation clinics in private hospitals can resemble four star hotels.<br>
<br>
We found in many countries - from Brazil and Argentina to India, Russia,
Romania, Turkey to South Africa and parts of the United States - a kind of
'apartheid medicine' that divides the world into two distinctly different
populations of 'organs supplies' and 'organs receivers'.&quot;<br>
<br>
Russia, together with Estonia, China and Iraq, is, indeed, a major harvesting
and trading centre. International news agencies described, five years ago, how
a grandmother in Ryazan tried to sell her grandchild to a mediator. The boy was
to be smuggled to the West and there dismembered for his organs. The uncle, who
assisted in the matter, was supposed to collect $70,000 - a fortune in Russian
terms.<br>
<br>
When confronted by the European Union on this issue, Russia responded that it
lacks the resources required to monitor organ donations. The Italian magazine,
Happy Web, reports that organ trading has taken to the Internet. A simple query
on the Google search engine yields thousands of Web sites purporting to sell
various body parts - mostly kidneys - for up to $125,000. The sellers are
Russian, Moldovan, Ukrainian and Romanian.<br>
<br>
Scheper-Hughes, an avid opponent of legalizing any form of trade in organs,
says that &quot;in general, the movement and flow of living donor organs -
mostly kidneys - is from South to North, from poor to rich, from black and
brown to white, and from female to male bodies&quot;.<br>
<br>
Yet, in the summer of 2002, bowing to reality, the American Medical Association
commissioned a study to examine the effects of paying for cadaveric organs
would have on the current shortage. The 1984 National Organ Transplant Act that
forbids such payments is also under attack. Bills to amend it were submitted
recently by several Congressmen. These are steps in the right direction.<br>
<br>
Organ trafficking is the outcome of the international ban on organ sales and
live donor organs. But wherever there is demand there is a market. Excruciating
poverty of potential donors, lengthening patient waiting lists and the better
quality of organs harvested from live people make organ sales an irresistible
proposition. The medical professions and authorities everywhere would do better
to legalize and regulate the trade rather than transform it into a form of
organized crime. The denizens of aMoldova would surely appreciate it.</span> </p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Interview granted to the <a
href="http://www.adevarul.ro/locale/galati/Sam-Varkin-fiecare-romani-rinichii_0_374362621.html">Romanian
newspaper Adevarul</a></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>Q. Do you think there are huge networks of traffic in
organs that operate in Romania?&nbsp;How many Romanians it is estimated, in
your opinion,&nbsp;annually sell organs?</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>A.</i></b> &quot;Huge&quot; would be an exaggeration.
Globally, about 10,000 organs are illegally harvested and transplanted each
year. Donors in Moldova receive c. $3000 per kidney and in Romania - double
this amount. There are c. 600 known donors in Moldova and no figures available
for Romania. Still, it would be safe to assume that more than 2000 Romanian
citizens have sold their organs in the last decade. Each year, about 100
Romanians sell kidneys to Israeli brokers who work with South-African hospitals
and another 200-300 sell organs, mostly kidneys, to criminal rings and networks
with connections to Turkey, Brazil, Italy, and the USA. Romanian organs are
expensive and so organ harvesting has shifted to Asia and parts of Latin
America.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Organ sellers - euphemistically called &quot;donors&quot; -
are mainly poor, unemployed, and Roma. Romanians who want to emigrate or are in
debt&nbsp;sometimes end up selling their organs or brokering such sales from
prisoners, soldiers, and even adolescents. It is easy to find
advertising&nbsp;related to organ trafficking on the Internet and even in the
daily papers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>Q. What method is used more often in the case of
Romania? Romanians who want to sell their organs are taken abroad to have their
organs removed? Or, they are operated in Romania, then the organs are removed
from the country? Or both methods are used?</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>A.</i></b> Actually, organ sellers are
often&nbsp;flown from other countries (even from Israel)&nbsp;INTO Romania. The
organs are then harvested in Romania. Rarely, the&nbsp;organs are
transplanted&nbsp;in Romania using fraudulent&nbsp;affidavits claiming that the
donor and recipient are relatives. More frequently, the organs are flown
to&nbsp;other countries, such as South Africa and Turkey, where the operations
take place. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many people are involved ie
donor and recipient are relatives. More frn these networks: from petty
criminals to politicians and from medical doctors to businessmen. In Romania,
the typical organ broker is a donor: someone who sold his kidney. Small-time
criminals are also involved as well as officials in Customs and Immigration
and, to a lesser extent, the Police and the Airports. Even hospital directors
are in on the take.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p  sold his kidney. Small-time
criminals are also involved as well as officials in Customs and Immiclass=MsoNormal>A typical patient pays c.&nbsp;$120.000 per&nbsp;transplant,
so there is a lot of money to divide.&nbsp;It is no wonder that Romania was the
only country not to attend the conference that yielded the Istanbul Declaration
against organ trafficking and transplant tourism!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Generally speaking: trafficked organs are either sold
domestically, or exported to be transplanted into patients from the US, Europe,
the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and especially Israel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>Q Have you heard or seen cases in which the Romanians
sold their organs?</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A. Yes, and so have you: Robert Mihaly in 2005.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>Q. What are the organs most commonly trafficked from
Eastern Europe?</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>A.</i></b> Kidneys are the most sought after,
extracted, sold, and transplanted. Harvesting a kidney poses few risks to the
donor. Kidneys are tiny and easy to conceal and smuggle.&nbsp;About 10,000
kidneys are harvested illegally each year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>Q. Are the rumors about harvesting organs from adopted
children true?</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>A.</i></b> No, they are not. Children's organs are
often ill-suited for transplantation for histological and immunological
reasons. So, the stories about Israeli adoption agencies which work in tandem
with Israeli doctors to extract organs from Romanian children are nonsense and
merely the latest version of the medieval anti-Semitic blood libel. Still, I am
ashamed to say that Israeli doctors are very prominent in the organ trafficking
and transplant tourism business. </p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Interview granted to El Pais</span></b></p>

<p><b><i>Q. Why do Israelis buy more organs for transplantation than other
nations?</i></b></p>

<p>A. Because Israeli doctors and businessmen (and, more generally, Jewish
doctors in places like South Africa) are heavily involved in the trade. Jewish
religion forbids the donation of organs from a living person. So, in Israel,
there is an enormous shortage of organs coupled with a sizable purchasing
power. It is simply easier for an Israeli to find the right connections as all
the roads lead to Tel-Aviv.</p>

<p><b><i>Q. Which countries provide the most donors?</i></b></p>

<p>A. In Europe: Moldova, Romania, Belarus, Ukraine, and, to some extent,
Albania, Kosovo, and the former republics of Yugoslavia (Serbia,
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia). In the Americas: Mexico, Haiti, Bolivia, Peru. In
Asia: Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, and Vietnam. In Africa: Nigeria and the
countries of sub-Saharan Africa. But there are donors who hail from rich
countries as well: even from Israel. Still, demand gravitates to where supply
is abundant and cheapest. In Moldova and Turkey donors sell a kidney for
200-500 euros; in Romania, Romas sell the same organs for double or triple
that; while Israeli donors demand up to 10,000 USD per kidney. Normally, buyers
prefer Moldovan or Turkish donors.</p>

<p><b><i>Q. How does a person how want to buy an organ find his way?</i></b></p>

<p>A. Predominantly through his doctors. In a few cases, he may know someone
who has had a similar procedure. There are even Internet chat rooms, bulletin
boards, and forums where such information is exchanged.</p>

<p><b><i>Q. How many organs have been bought in the last 2 years in the Middle
East?</i></b></p>

<p>A. Arab patients in the Gulf States, Israelis, Egyptians, Iranians and Turks
are the most numerous clients for such operations. But the surgical procedures
themselves � harvesting e been bought in the last 2 years in the Middle
East?</i></b></p>

<p>A. Arab patients in the Gulf States, Israelis, Egyptians, Iranians and Turks
are the most numerous clients for such operations. But the surgical procedures
themselvthe organs and then transplanting them � take place in
other locations: Kosovo, Turkey, South Africa, Morocco. In total, about 12,000
organs are illegally traded every year the world over. Middle Eastern patients
account for c. 2400 of these.</p>

<p><b><i>Q. Has the organ trade decreased or increased in the last 10 years in
this area? </i></b></p>

<p>A. Increased dramatically as the business has been taken over by organized
crime networks, aided and abetted by businessmen, financiers, hoteliers, truck
operators, politicians, customs officers, local doctors, judges, police
officers, and other officials, including representatives of the international
community. Everyone has been corrupted by this scourge.</p>

<p><b><i>Q. How much can an organ cost? (let�s say a kidney) </i></b></p>

<p>A. The patient pays between 100-150,000 USD for a kidney transplant,
including two weeks of convalescence in a five-star hotel for him and his
immediate family.</p>

<p><b><i>Q. How much does the donor /seller receive?</i></b></p>

<p>A. Donors typically receive between 1000-2000 USD per kidney (about 1-2% of
the cost to the recipient patient). Many donors in distress or those who want
to emigrate sell organs for much less. Retinas, hearts, lungs, even bone marrow
are also harvested and sold.</p>

<p><b><i>Q. How much does the doctor get? How much does the clinic and the
stuff performing the operation? How much the mediators?</i></b></p>

<p>A. A typical operation involves 2 surgeons, 1 anaesthesiologist, 2 nurses,
and 1 specialist (cardiologist, nephrologist, etc.) The surgeons receive 20,000
USD each; the specialist (who only monitors the patient and serves as a
consultant) about 10,000 USD; the anaesthesiologist about 5000 USD; and each of
the nurses about 2000 USD per operation. The rest goes to the long chain of
mediators involved. The brokers pay off everyone else: truck drivers,
receptionists at the hotels; customs officers; judges; policemen; and midlevel
politicians.</p>

<p><b><i>Q. What is the role of Turkey in all this? Are Turkey�s clinics or
doctors into this illegal business?</i></b></p>

<p>A. Turkey is a major junction in the trafficking of illicit organs. Turkish
doctors work closely with Israeli and Jewish doctors the world over. They
operate on both donors and recipients. They run illegal clinics all over the
world, including in Turkey, where many transplants take place as part of a
phenomenon of �transplant tourism� (mostly next to Antalian resorts). They
recruit donors. The whole business would be unimaginable without the Turks.
Recently, Israeli and Turkish networks have started to infiltrate Russia (with
the help of the Russian mafia) and the Turkic former republics of the USSR as
well as Kazakhstan and through these, China. This is the next �growth market�.</p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Interview granted to Zaman daily in
Turkey, January 2013</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>- As you mentioned in the same interview; in Israel
harvesting and transplantation are banned. Do you know these activities are
carried out illegally in Israel as well?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are no harvesting operations in Israel, but organ
donations and transplantations do take place, especially after a 2008 law
regulated the field by legalizing certain activities and criminalizing the
trading, trafficking, or brokering of organs.<br>
<br>
<b>- You claimed &quot;Organ trafficking would be unimaginable without
Turks&quot; Why do you think Turks (Probably you mean Turkish doctors) have a
strategic place in this illegal business?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because it is a fact. And I do mean &quot;Turks&quot;:
Turkish doctors, Turkish nurses, Turkish criminals, corrupt Turkish policemen
and customs officers, corrupt judges and local politicians, Turkish tour
operators and hotel staff, and Turkish bankers and financiers. Turkey is no
longer the main center of organ trafficking as it used to be until 2004,
though: it has lost some business to South-Africa, China, Russia, and countries
throughout Asia. Still, it is a major center for this illicit activity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<b>- How Turkish and Israeli doctors get connected for the aim of trafficking
organs?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many of them meet each other in medical conferences, but in
the majority of cases they are introduced to each other by organ brokers and
financiers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<b>- You said there are illegal clinics where the transplantation operated. Are
there any in Turkey? Where exactly in which cities?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They are in Turkey, mainly in Antalya (some of them adjacent
to tourist resorts.) Most of the clinics that used to operate in Istanbul in
the 1990s were shut down over the last decade by the Turkish authorities.<br>
<br>
<b>- Do you agree if I would say some security officials and politicians are also
in this business?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yes, I would: relatively low-level police officers
(especially the border police), customs officials, and municipal politicians.<br>
<br>
<b>- What is the importance of Turkey in the regional and global organ
trafficking?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Turkey is one of the main centers where the actual
transplantations take place. Organ brokers fly in with the refrigerated and
containerized organs from all over Europe; tour operators reserve rooms for the
patient and his family in a resort hotel whose staff is paid to look the other
way; doctors fly in from Israel, team up with Turkish doctors and nurses and do
the operations. The patient recovers in the resort and then returns home.<br>
<br>
<b>- Are there any Israeli donors who went out of the country for selling his
organ or can this operation take place illegally in Israel as well?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Israeli donors fly to other destinations (in Africa and
Asia) to have their organs harvested. Organ donation is legal in Israel only
after the brain death of the donor has been certified by 2 doctors.<br>

<b>- How can we get the numbers of the people in Israel who waits for a
transplantation operation for kidney and other organs? Do you have any info
about this?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are more than 1000 patients on the official waiting
list for organs maintained by the National Transplant and Organ Donation
Center, mostly kidneys.<br>
<br>
<b>- What is the importance of South Africa in organ trafficking? What about
Jews living in other parts of the world?<br>
</b><br>
Owing to its large Jewish population, South Africa has become a major center of
organ transplantation, similar to Turkey. Jews - mainly orthodox Jews - and
Israelis are involved in organ trafficking all over Europe and Africa, South
America, and North America. Most of the illegal trade in organs in Asia does
not involve Jews, except in China, where Israeli doctors have set up several
clinics recently.</p>
