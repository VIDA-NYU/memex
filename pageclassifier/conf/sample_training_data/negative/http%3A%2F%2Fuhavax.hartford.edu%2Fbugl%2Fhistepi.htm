  <p class="MsoNormal">Every infection is a race between the microbes and the
  host. The microbe, following the indelible rules of evolution, strives to
  survive and reproduce, while the host's immune system mounts a warlike defense
  designed to find, destroy, and eliminate it. An agent that kills its host
  quickly cannot be expected to survive long enough to reproduce. Thus excessive
  virulence is not selected for in evolution. Germs, which can reproduce and be
  passed from one host to another, are favored. <span style="font-size:13.5pt;

  <p class="MsoNormal">The <b><span style="color:blue">prevalence</span></b> of
  a disease is the number of diseased individuals at any one time (point
  prevalence) or over a given period (period prevalence). The <b><span style="color:blue">incidence</span></b>
  is the number of <i>new</i> cases of a disease thce</span></b> of
  a disease is the number of diseased individuals at any one time (pointat occur within a defined
  population over an established period of time. Frequently either prevalence or
  incidence, or both, are given as a <b><span style="color:blue">rate</span></b>,
  meaning the number of cases in a fixed number of people, e.g., cases per
  100,000. Individual cases of disease in widely separated geographic areas or
  otherwise independent cases are said to be <b><span style="color:blue">sporadic</span></b>.
  Any excessive and related incidence of a particular disease above what is
  normally expected in a population is defined to be an <b><span style="color:blue">epidemic</span></b>.
  When an epidemic extends beyond the confines of a wide area, typically a
  continent, and becomes a more widespread problem, it is a <b><span style="color:blue">pandemic</span></b>.
  <b><span style="color:red">AIDS</span></b> today is a pandemic disease,
  insofar as cases have been diagnosed on every continent, save Antarctica. Any
  disease with a low to moderate normal base level incidence rate in the
  population, but not necessarily constant, is said to be <b><span style="color:blue">endemic</span></b>.
  The common cold is endemic in northern latitudes.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Individuals who are infected and show either no or only
  mild symptoms are said to have a <b><span style="color:blue">subclinical
  infection</span></b>. Subclinically infected individuals with no symptoms are
  identified as <b><span style="color:blue">well-carriers </span></b>of the
  disease because they are carrying and frequently shedding the disease agent.
  The following table gives the <b><span style="color:blue">incubation period</span></b><span style="color:blue">
  </span>(time between exposure and the first detectable symptom), <b><span style="color:blue">latency
  period</span></b> (time when the disease is concealed, hidden, or inactive),

  which the disease can be transmitted with or without contact) for several
  common diseases.</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal">There are two major types of infectious diseases which
  can develop into epidemics: common source and host-to-host. <b><span style="color:blue">Common
  source</span></b> epidemics arise from a contaminated source, such as water or
  food, while <b><span style="color:blue">host-to-host</span></b><span style="color:blue">
  </span>infections are transmitted from one infected individual to another via
  various, perhaps indirect, routes.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Anything causing disease is called a <b><span style="color:blue">pathogen</span></b>.
  A <b><span style="color:blue">vector</span></b> is an organism that serves as
  an intermediary in the transmission of a host-to-host disease. For instance,
  many infections are transmitted by mosquitoes, fleas, ticks, etc. to people. A
  <b><span style="color:blue">fomite</span></b> is any inanimate object that
  adheres to or transmits infecy in the transmission of a host-to-host disease. For instance,
  many infections are transmitted by mosquitoes, fleas, ticks, etc. to people. A

  <p class="MsoNormal">Common source epidemics usually produce more new cases
  earlier and faster than host-to-host epidemics. Once the infected source is
  closed, sealed, or removed, the common source epidemic usually abates rapidly.
  Host-to-host epidemics are slower to grow and slower to diminish.</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal">You should pay special attention to the number of
  common-source epidemic diseases that are due to contamination of water and
  food by-products of human excretion. Hikers and campers can purchase water
  filters that are sufficiently fine that most of the nonviral pathogens cannot
  pass through them.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The tables below list several common source and
  host-to-host epidemics, the causative agent (followed by V for virus, B for
  bacteria, and P for protozoa), sources of infection, and the reservoirs of the
  infection. Current knowledge tells us that humans are the only reservoirs for
  sexually transmitted diseases.</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal">The colonization of a susceptible, unimmunized host by a
  microbe may lead to exponential growth of the parasite and an epidemic. In
  time the host population develops resistance and the spread of the microbe may
  be checked and some form of equilibrium may be reached. Genetic changes in the
  host could destroy the parasite or a change in the microbe could initiate
  another epidemic. The disease would continue until the host develops an
  appropriate response to check the microbes' growth. As this process continues,
  each agent affects the evolution of the other; in this case, the two organisms
  are said to be <b><span style="color:blue">coevolving</span></b>. This
  coevolution is a process of continuous change as both organisms follow the
  rules of evolution and move toward greater diversity.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">A classic example of coevolution dates back to the 1950s.
  European settlers introduced rabbits to Australia in 1859. With few natural
  predators, the rabbits did what rabbits always do, and soon they covered most
  of the continent, wreaking environmental havoc. Scientists studied the myxoma
  virus, spread by mosquitoes, which exists in equilibrium with South American
  rabbits, but is deadly to European rabbits. In 1950 the virus was introduced
  in an attempt to control the rabbit population. The first year saw 95% of the
  infected rabbits dead of myxomatosis. As the weaker hosts died off, the virus
  mutated to a less virulent strain. At the same time, the rabbit population
  consisted only of those remaining that, when challenged by the virus,
  survived. As the two organisms coevolved over about six years, both the virus
  and the rabbits survived, albeit at reduced levels. What remained were the
  less virulent virus and the immunologically stronger rabbits. The rabbit
  population stabilized at about 20% of the pre-epidemic levels.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="color:blue">Herd immunity</span></b><span style="color:blue">
  </span>is the resistance of a group of organisms to invasion and spread of an
  infectious agent resulting from immunity of a large proportion of the members
  of the group. If the fraction of immune individuals is sufficiently large, the
  entire population will be protected from the ravages of an epidemic. This
  protective fraction is a function of the virulence of the pathogen, the
  duration of infectivity, and the general state of the host population.
  Fractions as low as 0.70 will suffice for diphtheria and polio, but influenza
  will not be stopped by herd immunity until the protected fraction is in excess
  of 0.90.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Not all diseases can erupt into epidemics. The microbe
  needs to be transmitted to new hosts in order to continue reproducing. In
  small towns everyone could contract the disease in such a short time that the
  pathogen could die out. There is a critical size for a group below which the
  disease cannot become an epidemic, but above which it can. Historical records
  seem to indicate that in human habitations this size is about 250,000. Thus
  major epidemics did not find their way into recorded history until cities

  <p class="MsoNormal">Arguably the ultimate scourge of mankind (and over 100
  species of animals) was the so-called Black Death. The generic
  &quot;plague&quot; (with a lower case p) has entered the language as a
  descriptor for any deadly epidemic disease. Plague (with an upper case P) is
  caused by <i><span style="color:blue">Yersinia pestis</span></i>, a
  rod-shaped, Gram negative bacterium. As few as one bacterium is an infective
  dose! This electron micrograph is from Dennis Kunkel's <a href="http://www.pbrc.hawaii.edu/~kunkel">webpage</a>,

  <p class="MsoNormal">Its reservoir consists of the fleas (the Indian rat flea,
  <i>Xenopsylla cheopsis</i>, of which only adult females feed on hosts. <i>X.
  cheopsis</i> is fairly hardy and can survive for 6 to 12 months off a host in
  dung, an abandoned rodent's nest, textile bales, and on rodents, such as
  prairie dogs, rats, squirrels, gerbils, field mice, etc. The micrograph of the
  flea was made at the University of Queensland in Australia.<span style="font-size:13.5pt;

  <p class="MsoNormal"><i>Y. pestis</i> is <b><span style="color:blue">enzootic</span></b>;
  meaning it is endemic to these rodents (the <b><font color="#0000FF">reservoir</font></b>),
  and can even survive in their burrows after an <b><span style="color:blue">epizootic</span></b><span style="color:blue">
  </span>(an epidemic arising from a transfer of disease from animals).</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Black rats (<i>Rattus rattus</i>-which were common in
  ancient times, but have since been supplanted by the larger and more
  aggressive brown rats, <i>Norvegicus rattus</i>) rarely move more than 200
  meters from their nest and are good climbers, hence their adaptability to the
  thatched roof homes of either the Middle Ages, present day rural Africa, or
  parts of the Asian subcontinent. Normally the fleas live on the rodents in a
  form of equilibrium, but sometimes that equilibrium is upset when the organism
  multiplies rapidly in the flea's gut, eventually blocking the lumen (the space
  within its gut) so that the flea regurgitates infected material as it attempts
  to feed. This infects the rodent and it contracts a form of the fatal disease
  called <b><span style="color:blue">murine</span></b> or <b><span style="color:blue">silvatic
  Plague</span></b>. When infected, rats are asymptomatic until near death,
  whereupon they swell up (because the <i>Y. pestis</i> grow so rapidly and in
  such large numbers that they block the biliary duct) and stagger as if
  intoxicated. The fleas then leave their dying hosts and seek residence in the
  nearest warm-blooded animals. Considering that fleas can jump several feet,
  &quot;nearest&quot; is a relative term.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">One to six days after a human receives a flea bite, the
  lymph nodes in the armpit (axilla) and groin become very tender and swollen
  (as large as an egg <span style="color:purple">[They range from 1 to 10 cm in
  diameter.]</span>). These very painful swollen areas are called <b><span style="color:blue">buboes</span></b>
  (from the Greek <i>bubo</i>, meaning groin). The buboes may <b><span style="color:blue">suppurate</span></b>,
  i.e., break and discharge a particularly fetid pus. Each of the buboes shown
  below are on children (to give you a perspective of size).<span style="font-size:13.5pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal">Sometimes the original bite site becomes infected and
  suppurates. It is not rare for the area of the bite to become gangrenous and
  necrotic, i.e., the tissue dies. Other symptoms include restlessness,
  staggering gait, mental confusion, prostration, delirium, rapid pulse, nausea,
  aching of the extremities and back, and a high fever (at least 40�
  C&nbsp;=&nbsp;104� F). Then one of two avenues is followed. If the fever
  breaks, there is usually remission and the immune system has gained the upper
  hand over the pathogen, which it then proceeds to destroy and expel. If the
  fever doesn't break, the infection spreads to the blood, causing septicemia
  and death. This is the course of <b><span style="color:blue">bubonic Plague</span></b>.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">In some cases the microbe can proceed directly to the
  blood stream and this <b><span style="color:blue">septicemic Plague</span></b>
  can occur <i>before</i> the formation of buboes and results in death before a
  diagnosis can be made. Some scientists feel that this form of Plague can even
  be carried by either the common human flea or the body louse. In septicemia,
  blood vessels break and leak under the skin causing a dark rash as the blood
  dries (hence the name <i>Black Death</i> which was given in the 1500s).</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">For both bubonic and septicemic Plague, there is
  hemorrhagic illness (bleeding), multiple system failure, and death. All of
  this occurs within three to seven days. The mortality rate for untreated
  bubonic Plague is about 50-75% and 100% for septicemic Plague.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">As it rages throughout the population, Plague can change
  to a more virulent form and enters the lungs, whereupon the victims initially
  cough up a blood-spotted mucus and then graduate to coughing bloody froth, all
  the while spreading the disease by aerosol droplets. This <b><span style="color:blue">pneumonic
  Plague</span></b> has a 100% mortality rate, if untreated, and death can occur
  in a matter of hours. Small children having the Plague frequently went into
  convulsions, wherein their bodies jerked about uncontrollably prior to
  death-not a pleasant sight.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Streptomycin, gentamicin, and tetracycline are treatments
  of choice for all three varieties of Plague. Penicillin has no effect.
  Medication must be given within the first 18 hours of infection to be
  completely effective.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Quarantine (from the Italian <i>quarentina</i>, meaning
  forty days <font color="#008000">[based on no scientific reason, but rather on
  the number of days the bible said Christ spent in the wilderness]</font> for
  the time of isolation of ships entering harbor which were suspected of
  carrying some form of contagion) is only somewhat effective at the outset of
  an outbreak. In the fourteenth century, Milan, Florence, and Venice employed
  quarantines with a vengeance. The homes of sufferers were sealed�well and
  sick left to die for lack of food and water. Of course, the human residents of
  such dwellings were constrained, while the rats could come and go as they
  pleased. Even rats aboard docked quarantined ships had easy egress, because
  they could climb down the mooring ropes and onto the docks.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The major Plague epidemics occurred in 540 at Pelusium,
  Egypt, reached Constantinople in 542 and spread into Europe and Asia (the
  Plague of Justinian) in the following decade; 14<sup>th</sup> century Europe,
  following the caravan routes, it was in the lower Volga River basin in 1345,
  the Caucasus and Crimea by 1346, Constantinople by 1347, Alexandria in the
  autumn of 1347, Cyprus and Sicily in that year, Italy by winter 1347,
  Marseilles by January of 1348, Paris in spring 1348, followed by Germany and
  the Low Countries in that year, Norway in May 1349, eastern Europe by 1350,
  and finally Russia in 1351, but smaller outbreaks continued for about 200 more
  years; Austria in 1711; the Balkans from 1770-1772. The last major pandemic
  ran from 1855-1896 worldwide, but mostly in China and India, wherein more than
  12 million died. Manchuria in 1910�1911 witnessed about 60,000 deaths due to
  pneumonic Plague with a repeat in 1920�1921; and a minor outbreak occurred
  as recently as the summer of 1994 in Surat, India closely following an
  earthquake in September 1993.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">From 1150-1200 there was a major warming throughout
  Europe. This, coupled with the rise of the mercantile class, led to improved
  diet and greater population growth. aBy 1340, Europe was significantly
  overpopulated. This was followed by the so-called Little Ice Age, which ended
  by 1351. The resulting climate was colder and wetter than normal. With
  population higher than it had been in some time, and crop yields reduced, per
  capita caloric intake fell precipitously, general health declined, and the
  pest population increased. Not a welcome combination of circumstances.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">There are several theories to explain the onset of
  Plague, but they all agree that a major source was China, Mongolia, and Hunan
  province, in particular. The nomadic tribesmen that populated the region
  seemed to know instinctively that something was amiss. A series of customs
  arose designed to keep the microbe in check. Trapping marmots (a host for <i>X.
  cheopis</i>) was taboo; marmots could be shot at a distance only; slow-moving
  animals were to be avoided; furs of certain rodents could not be used.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Around 1330 Plague affected the local residents of the
  Orient and following the elaborate trade routes, established in the previous
  two centuries, made its way west. By 1345, it was in the lower Volga; by 1346
  Astrakhan, the Caucasus, and Azerbijian; by 1346 Constantinople and the
  Byzantine Empire; late autumn 1347 Alexandria, Egypt and southward along the
  Nile; India and what is now the middle east were next to be depopulated by
  the, soon to be ubiquitous, flea and its internal traveling companion.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">During the summer of 1347 Genoese merchants and their
  families were living in the city of Kaffa on the Black Sea, in the Crimea,
  when it was subjected to a siege by Tartars. As the effects of the prolonged
  siege seemed to be overcoming the resistance of the residents, an outbreak of
  disease decimated the Tartar forces. In a fit of rage, the remains of the
  departing army are rumored to have catapulted corpses of the disease victims
  into the city. The merchants hastily departed the city in twelve vessels and
  set sail for Italy. October 1347 found the Genoese fleet outside the port of
  Messina, Sicily and the crews, or what was left of them, were found to be
  dying of some unknown malady. Michael of Piazza described the arrival of the
  sailors as <i>&quot;sickness clinging to their very bones.&quot;</i> City
  officials sealed the vessels for two days�but, of course, this had little
  effect on the rats, and their accompanying fleas, who easily descended the
  mooring lines�and then dispatched them to their home port. Within two months
  nearly half of the population of Messina was dead. The disease soon spread
  throughout the ports of Italy and reached the inland cities by early spring;
  in most cases halving their populations. Reports of another Genoese merchant
  ship carrying the disease to Marseilles came in January 1348. By that summer,
  the Plague reached Paris. It then spread east to Germany and north to England,
  reaching London in December 1348. During this time it came to be known by the
  names: the Great Dying, <i>das Grosse Sterben</i>, the Plague of Justinian,
  and <i>Magna Mortalis</i>.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">At that time, the population of England was estimated to
  be about four million, yet within a mere two and a half years about one third
  of them had died. Fully one third of the residents of Florence died in the
  first six months and 45%-75% in a single year. Venice lost 60% of its populace
  over the year and a half that the epidemic raged. Death was so rampant that
  the pope had to consecrate the Rhone River so corpses could be dumped into it.
  The death toll throughout Europe was at least 25 million out of a total
  population of 40 million. (In warmer months and in southern Europe, at this
  time, there was at least one family of black rats per household and an
  estimated average of three fleas per rat.)</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Clergy were especially hard hit; 50% of the English
  clergy died; in Montpellier, of 140 Dominican friars at the outset, only seven
  survived; one third of the cardinals went to their eternal reward. Their
  numbers were slow to recover, taking several generations and some orders
  remained depleted until well into the seventeenth century.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">This outbreak of Plague was accelerated by a total
  absence of sanitary procedures and lack of knowledge. For instance, the dead
  were heaped in piles, whereupon rats and dogs fed on the corpses and the cycle
  was extended. Homes were more like sties than what we would associate with
  buildings fit for human habitation. Roofs and walls were made of straw; floors
  were dirt; animals were kept inside. The streets, if that's what you could
  call them, of cities were barely wide enough for a single cart to pass, and
  they were perpetually covered with mud, garbage, and excrement. For lack of
  heated water, people rarely bathed and fleas were commonplace. When St. Thomas
  � Becket was prepared for burial in England in 1170, he was found to be
  wearing (from the outside in) (i) a large brown mantle, (ii) a white surplice,
  (iii) a coat of lambs' wool, (iv) a woolen pelisse, (v) another woolen
  pelisse, (vi) the black robe of the Benedictine order, (vii) a shirt, and
  (viii) a tight-fitting suit of coarse hair-cloth covered on the exterior with
  linen. During preparation for burial the cold Engl, (iv) a woolen pelisse, (v) another woolen
  pelisse, (vi) the black robe of the Benedilish air stimulated so many
  of the critters occupying his hair suit that it &quot;boiled over with them
  like water in a simmering cauldron.&quot;</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><i>Rosies</i> are rosary beads, presumably to gain divine
  intercession against this mysterious enemy. Most Plague victims emitted a
  rather strong and rather objectionable odor, so flowers <i>(posies</i>) were
  carried to mask the smell. <i>Ashes</i> are all that was left of a burnt
  corpse. Of course, to <i>fall down</i> means to die. Sometimes the second last
  line is replaced with <i>&quot;A Tishoo, a tishoo,&quot;</i> meaning the
  sneezes of the victims of pneumonic Plague. To be sneezed on by them was a
  sure death sentence for all but the hardiest souls. <font color="#008000">[There

  <p class="MsoNormal">Throughout Europe, many areas were abandoned. Agriculture
  came to a virtual standstill as farmers fled or died in their fields.
  Consequently, food shortages compounded the problems of society. Governments
  ground to a halt as bureaucrats died. No civil authority remained and crime
  was rampant. Station in life was not an indicator of immunity. Plague attacked
  merchants and peasants with equal voracity. Only the very rich could afford to
  move to protected environs far from the disease and even that was no guarantee
  of survival.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Everyone feared the spreading contagion and no efforts
  were spared to avoid its fatal embrace. <i>&quot;Kinsmen held aloof, brother

  <p class="MsoNormal">The &quot;order&quot; of <b><span style="color:blue">flagellants</span></b>,
  also called the Brethren of the Cross, (initially active in the late 1200s)
  was re-formed in Germany in 1348 and initially blessed by the pope. It forbade
  its members from bathing, washing their heads, shaving, sleeping in a bed,
  having any contact with the opposite sex, or even changing their clothes
  during a procession without permission of the &quot;Master&quot;. Washing of
  hands was allowed, but only once a day and that had to be done when kneeling.
  Each member had to donate funds to cover the cost of their food for the
  duration. As if to satisfy the ascetic needs of a squeamish populace, the
  groups went from town to town and whipped themselves with scourges, i.e.,
  sticks with three or four leather tails with large knots containing sharpened
  iron spikes. They continued until the blood ran and even when the spikes stuck
  in the skin and had to be torn out. Many of them died of infections of these
  open wounds. They formed in bands of 50 to 300 and moved in pairs with men in
  the front and women in the rear of this serpentine procession. Each group's
  &quot;Master&quot; heard confessions, imposed penances, and granted absolution�all
  to the total horror of the local clergy, who had enjoyed an absolute monopoly
  (and accompanying fees) over such practices for centuries. Each procession
  lasted 33<span style="mso-bidi-font-family:Arial">&#8531;</span> days, the
  number of years Christ was said to have spent on earth. During their travels
  through Germany and the Low Countries they preached anti-Semitism. Their
  asceticism had no effect on the state of the epidemic and their personal
  hygiene may have helped to carry Plague from village to village. Eventually,
  in October of 1349, the pope ordered the military arm of the church to force
  the groups to disband.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Upon commission of the pope in 1348, a group of learned
  men (and at that time only men were deemed capable of being educated and
  hence, learned) of the medical faculty at Paris concluded that the disaster
  was a result of a conjunction of Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars in the 40<sup>th</sup>
  degree of Aquarius at 1:00 p.m. on March 20, 1345. This caused hot, moist
  conditions, which forced the earth to exhale a virulent sulfurous miasma. So
  much for the Age of Aquarius!</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The horror and fear faced by medieval people confronted
  with the bizarre and almost totally unknown symptoms of Plague is
  inconceivable to us today. To those who believed in spirits and devils (that
  was most of the people of the time), this infestation was a scene from their
  worst nightmares; one in which they were completely unable to effect relief,
  no less a cure. It was as if all the monsters of their psyches were being
  unleashed for reasons they could not comprehend. When your worldview is
  limited, your options in the face of calamity are even more limited. Any
  explanation is believable. The pope declared that it was not divine punishment
  for the sins of the world, but local clergy gave that as the <i>only</i>
  reason for such horrors. As a referent, you may want to look at a copy of the
  leftmost part of the triptych of Heironymous Bosch's the <i>Garden of Earthly
  Delights</i>.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">As with most mysterious, unknowable, and uncontrollable
  tragedies, the thin veneer of human rationality is peeled back to expose a
  dark undersurface capable of incomprehensible horrors and unimaginable evil.
  People sought to blame others; scapegoating was in season; <b><span style="color:blue">xenophobia</span></b>
  was the norm�all strangers were suspected of spreading disease. As had
  happened before and since, Jews were the targets of choice (even though they
  died of Plague at the same rate as others). Rumors of their having poisoned
  wells ran rampant. There were pogroms and massacres. The rabble was loose.
  Zurich expelled all its Jews and closed its gates to them. On a single day in
  1349, 2000 Jews were burned to death by a mob in Strausborg. Even officialdom
  entered the fray. The canton of Basel gathered all 4500 of its Jews in a
  specially built structure on an island in the Rhine and burned them to death,
  after which the town fathers passed a law forbidding Jewish residence in the
  canton for 200 years. The largest Jewish community in Europe was in Mainz,
  Germany where at least 6,000 Jews were incinerated after they fought and
  killed 200 of an attacking mob. Pogroms also occurred in Baden, Brussels,
  Burren, Dresden, Eisenach, Erfurt, Freiburg, Gotha, Landsberg, Lindau,
  Memmingen, Solothurn, Speyer, Stuttgart, Ulm, Worms, and Zofingen. There were
  over 350 separate recorded massacres of Jews during the years of the Plague.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The approach of a group of flagellants frequently incited
  townsfolk to embark on pogroms and when they didn't, the Brethren proceeded
  posthaste to the Jewish quarter where they murdered and looted with a
  viciousness, ferocity, and completeness that foretold the <i>Final Solution</i>
  of the Nazis in the twentieth century. Western Europe killed or expelled the
  Jews even as Pope Clement VI issued papal bulls forbidding plundering and
  killing them. As if on cue, local clergy either instigated anti-Semitic
  actions or failed to stop them, likely because properties of the Jews reverted
  to the Catholic Church upon the death of the families. What the Church lost in
  clergy and followers, it gained in tangible assets.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Eastern Europe, relatively unscathed by the Plague,
  tolerated the Jews. King Casimir of Poland offered to protect them. Some say
  it was because he had a Jewish mistress, but it is more likely that his
  country needed the skills they possessed. A return of the Jews to their former
  lands in western Europe was slow.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Once it ebbed, by the end of 1351, the Plague left Europe
  with a sizable shortage of workers and helped to destroy the feudal system
  when labor found itself in a seller's market. Abandoned homes were taken over
  by complete strangers, as there was a default redistribution of wealth.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The most generally agreed upon mortality figure was that
  one in three people were killed by the Plague�a total loss of well over 20
  million in Europe and perhaps as many as 40 million worldwide.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#008000">[As with all things ancient and
  historical, there remains room for controversy. Scott &amp; Duncan wrote <i>Biology
  of Plagues: Evidence from Historic Populations</i> wherein they claim that the
  medieval plague was not due to Plague at all, but rather to some form of
  hemorrhagic viral disease. S. Cohn disagrees with those authors only insofar
  as the cause of the disease. Nevertheless, French researchers found <i>Y.
  pestis</i> in the dental pulp of bodies buried in Montpellier during the 14th
  century. Adding to this is a October 2001 paper of Parkhill, et al. in <i>Nature</i>
  413:523-527. They announced the complete mapping of the bacterium's genome,
  all 4,653,728 base pairs (more of this in a later unit). They found 149
  deactivated genes that once enabled the bacterium to thrive in the human gut,
  but are no longer needed.]</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Although the Plague no longer killed millions, it
  remained present on the European continent for more than three hundred years,
  erupting in seemingly random locations until its final gasp in Marseilles in
  1720. The last major infestation of Plague (over a million died) arose in
  China and India in 1855 and reached Hong Kong in 1894. Estimates are that 12
  million died. It was here that Alexandre Yersin and Shibasaburo Kitasato
  independently described the causative agent. Strangely enough, it wasn't until
  1897 that P.L. Simond identified the mode of transmission.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Today Plague is endemic in various places; Madagascar,
  Tanzania, Brazil, Peru, Burma, and Vietnam have experienced cases almost <i>every
  year</i> since the start of the last pandemic in 1880, and rodents in the
  southwestern United States carry it! In fact, 40% of the U.S land area is
  infested by Plague-infected animals, mostly prairie dogs! Some national parks
  have signs saying not to feed the squirrels because they have Plague.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Since 1947, there have been 390 cases of Plague in the
  U.S. resulting in 60 deaths. From 1980-1994 this country has had 229 cases
  with 33 deaths. The last two Americans to succumb to Plague died in August
  1996, both due to transmission by way of prairie dogs. A thirteen year-old
  Kazakhstani boy died of bubonic Plague on August 9, 1999�the first such
  death in that country in 25 years. Many other nonfatal cases have been
  reported.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Today east Africa and Hunan province in China are
  permanent reservoirs, called <b><span style="color:blue">inveterate foci</span></b>,
  for the disease. During 1965-1971, Vietnam (in addition to fighting a war
  against the United States) reported 25,000 cases of Plague. The World Health
  Organization received reports of 18,739 cases in the period from 1980-1994, of
  which there were 1853 deaths (that's a 10% death rate) and between 2000 and
  3000 every year. What is disconcerting is that more cases were reported from
  1990-1994 than in the entire previous decade (an average of 2025 cases/year
  versus 861 cases/year).</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The last known case of human-to-human transmission
  occurred in Los Angeles in 1924.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The latest large, but not major, outbreak occurred on
  September 20, 1994 in the Indian city of Surat in the state of Gujarat.
  Initially the government of India did not recognize the presence of the
  disease until several hundred thousand people had fled the region. By October
  2, there had been 2500 cases reported and official figures of 58 deaths.
  Considering that this strain was the highly contagious pneumonic variety, thus
  spread by aerosol droplets upon respiration and was amenable to treatment with
  tetracycline, such a low mortality figure may or may not be comforting.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">A vaccine was available for those who expected to come in
  contact with animals that may have been infected, but it was not completely
  effective. The manufacturer discontinued production in 1999 and it is no
  longer available. It worked on bubonic Plague but not pneumonic.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Rather ominously, the September 4, 1997 issue of the <i>New
  England Journal of Medicine</i> carried a brief report from Galimand et al.
  describing a case of multiple antibiotic resistant bubonic Plague. The
  causative agent, <i>Y. pestis</i>, acquired a resistance plasmid from an
  unknown source. The thought of another worldwide pandemic of Plague that is
  resistant to modern medical treatment boggles the mind.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">On August 26, 1999 the wire services carried a story
  announcing the development of a vaccine for bubonic Plague designed to protect
  against bio-terrorism. Human trials were to b modern medicalegin shortly. We await the
  results.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">A separate issue is the use of <i>Y. pestis</i> for
  bio-warfare.&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal">Syphilis, or the Great Pox and later known as lues (named
  after the French kings Louis and pronounced the same), is caused by the
  spirochete <b><i><span style="color:blue">Treponema pallidum</span></i></b>. <span style="font-size:13.5pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal">This organism is extremely closely related to those
  treponemes that cause the nonfatal and nonsexually transmitted diseases yaws,
  pinta, and bejel. Although some medical historians claim the disease
  originated in the Western hemisphere and was brought back to Europe by
  Columbus's crew, others believe that it evolved (or coevolved) from yaws by
  mutation. Consider the question as unresolved to this day.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Its original form was more virulent than what we see
  today and its symptoms were more florid. Despite all efforts, <i>T. pallidum</i>
  has not been cultivated in the laboratory in any artificial media (one more
  example which defies Koch's Postulates) and it is extremely difficult to
  cultivate in the presence of human cells.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The disease is spread by close personal contact: either
  by contact with the exudate from open sores through breaks in the skin, sexual
  transmission, or vertical transmission from mother to developing fetus
  (resulting in <b><span style="color:blue">congenital syphilis</span></b>). The
  symptoms are highly variable. The spirochete multiplies at the initial site of
  entry and a characteristic primary lesion, called a <b><span style="color:blue">chancre</span></b>,
  forms within two to ten weeks.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><a href="images/chancre1.jpg"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1050" src="http://uhavax.hartford.edu/bugl/images/chancre1.jpg" width="375" height="216"></a></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The exudate from the chancre is highly infectious.
  Despite its rather gruesome appearance, it usually heals and leaves no scar. <b>Primary
  syphilis</b>: from one to three months after exposure the host experiences
  enlarged inguinal lymph nodes as the immune system mounts a defense. <b>Secondary
  syphilis</b>: a flu-like illness develops and sometimes the immune system
  succeeds in its efforts and there is spontaneous resolution. If the immune
  system does not destroy the microbes, a generalized skin rash develops and the
  patient will be highly infectious, but within time, the organism disappears
  from the secondary lesions and the skin rash. Notice the circular marks with a
  light halo and dark interior.</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Tertiary Syphilis</b>: Some of the treponemes spread
  to other parts of the body, in particular, the mucous membranes, liver, eyes,
  joints, bones, muscles, or the central nervous system (CNS), where they again
  either multiply or remain dormant. Subsequently, the course of the disease is
  highly variable. About 25% of the victims undergo a spontaneous cure, another
  25% exhibit no further symptoms, and the remaining 50% proceed to the tertiary
  stage. At this stage, the symptoms depend on what organs have active pathogen
  replication; they range from a mild skin rash to significant central nervous

  <p class="MsoNormal">None of these third stage <b>gummas</b> or ulcers will
  heal to their original state. When the spirochete enters the central nervous
  system it can affect the spinal column, resulting in a condition called tabes
  dorsalis. This condition causes postural instability with a staggering wide
  base gait that can damage the joints of the leg. The condition shown below is
  called <b>Charcot's knee</b>.<span style="font-size:13.5pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

  <p class="MsoNormal">Surprisingly, there is usually no pain in the knee (Yes,
  that is a knee). This is a result of tabes dorsalis <font color="#008000">[sclerosis
  of the posterior columns of the spinal cord]</font> which causes postural
  instability and concomitant swelling.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Penicillin is effective in curing the disease, although
  the dosage and length of treatment are functions of the extent of infection.
  Usually, a <i>single</i> injection of one million units is sufficient.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Syphilis spread throughout Europe in the 1490s and was
  particularly lethal in its original manifestation. The disease was fulminant
  and the skin eruptions were especially gruesome. It caused genital sores,
  advanced to a general rash, and then developed into particularly ugly
  abscesses and scabs over the entire body. The sores changed to open ulcers
  that could erode bone and destroy tissue, especially eyes, lips, nose, throat,
  and genitals. As with most epidemics, the victims were blamed for the disease
  (debauchery, lechery, etc.) and frequently ostracized.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The bellicose nature of the regimes of the time, with
  their many standing armies, extensive use of mercenaries, and frequent
  battles, was conducive to rapid and efficient spread via the usual &quot;camp
  followers&quot; of the warring parties. The disease reached Germany and
  Switzerland in 1495, England and Holland in 1496. Vasco da Gama's crew carried
  it around the Cape in 1497 causing an outbreak in India in 1498, which in turn
  spread eastward. China and Japan were affected in 1505, a full fifteen years
  before the arrival of Portuguese sailors in Canton.</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal">Between 1497 and 1501, a number of medical tracts on the
  disease appeared. The writings of Leonicenus were especially good, insofar as
  the general symptoms were enumerated, their relation to sexual transmission
  was recognized, and the use of mercurial salts (an old Arabian practice) was
  advocated for treating the associated skin eruptions. Two famous Renaissance
  medical leaders, Paracelsus and Fracastorius, made major contributions to the
  study of this disease. Paracelsus was the first medical teacher to challenge
  the long-held theories of Galenic medicine. Fracastorius was a true
  Renaissance man; he wrote on the temperature of wines, the rise of the Nile,
  poetries, the mind, and the soul. He was an astronomer, geographer, botanist,
  mathematician, philosopher, and physician. He understood the true nature of
  sedimentary rocks, anticipated the principle of the Mercator projection, and
  described a primitive telescope. In 1530 he published the poem <i>Syphilis
  Sive Morbus Gallicus</i> (Syphilis or the French Disease), from which the name
  of the disease was derived.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">In the United States the incidence rate of all syphilis
  has varied from a high of 447.0 in 1943 to a low of 26.5 in 1995.
  Unfortunately, the rate is no longer decreasing and the rate of congenital
  syphilis is now substantially higher than it was in the 1980s. Worldwide there

  <p class="MsoNormal">An infective dose varies from 10<sup>6</sup> to 10<sup>11</sup>
  bacteria, with the higher number applying when the stomach's acidity is high
  (i.e., low pH), but it can go as low as 10<sup>4</sup> when ingested together
  with an antacid or food. The standard pH of an empty stomach is between 0.9
  and 3.0, generally around 1.0, and <i>Vibrios</i> are killed when the pH is
  below 2.4, so some people will not succumb to the disease.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Cholera is transmitted through contaminated water and
  manifests itself as an acute infection of the gastrointestinal tract. Although
  <i>Vibrios</i> are free living in water (in fact, they can survive on algae
  for quite some time), they cause infection only in humans. The bacteria bind
  to the walls of the small intestine where they secrete a potent toxin. This
  toxin alters the membrane transport mechanism; instead of causing the water to
  leave the lumen of the gut and enter the tissues, large quantities of water,
  chloride, and sodium are drawn into the gut.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The disease proceeds in possibly three stages (a) <b><i>Invasion</i></b><i>:</i>
  at the end of the incubation period the symptoms are malaise, headache, severe
  diarrhea resulting in the so-called &quot;<b><span style="color:blue">rice
  water stool</span></b>,&quot; (which derives its characteristic whitish color
  from intestinal tissue which is exfoliated (shed) and excreted along with
  innumerable Vibrios), anorexia, and a slight fever. This severe diarrhea can
  be as high as one liter per hour. The resulting loss of fluid and the
  accompanying electrolyte imbalance can lead to hypovolemic shock, renal
  failure, and cardiac failure. (b) <b><i>Collapse</i></b><i>:</i> circulation
  is almost completely arrested, accelerated respiration, weak pulse, decreased
  systolic blood pressure, diminished or no urine output. This stage lasts from
  a few hours to one or two days. The mind remains clear until just before
  death, when coma occurs. Death follows shortly thereafter. Death can follow
  the onset of symptoms in little as six hours. (c) <b><i>Reaction</i></b><i>:</i>
  sometimes, even when the grim reaper is about to claim victory, vomiting
  ceases, diarrhea becomes less frequent and less watery, and convalescence
  follows. Talk about your near-death experiences!</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Immediate oral or intravenous rehydration is essential to
  survival. Of course, victims may be in no mood to radically increase their
  oral intake of liquids, even when sweeteners and essential minerals are added.
  Untreated, the mortality rate is 40-60%, whereas immediate treatment can lower
  this to less than 1%, even with only oral rehydration therapy. As few as 30%
  and as many as 80% of those infected can be asymptomatic, and hence
  well-carriers who shed the <i>Vibrios </i>in their fecal matter, thus
  furthering infection of the populace. Once infected, further infection with
  the same subtype of <i>Vibrio</i> usually leads to at worst a subclinical
  infection, i.e., no appearance of classic symptoms. Although there is a
  vaccine, it is of modest value, because it is effective at most 50% of the
  time and lasts only for 3-6 months for <i>Vibrios</i> of the same subtype. The
  dominant subtype was <i>O1 classical</i>, but that has now been superseded by
  the <i>El Tor</i> biotype, which is less virulent, but more long lasting and
  has more well-carriers. Clinical trials of newer vaccines are ongoing.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">This disease has swept the world in seven major
  pandemics, including a major outbreak in South America, particularly Peru, as
  recently as 1991 (Avoid the <i>ceviche</i>!). Cases have also been reported
  along the Gulf coast of the U.S., usually the result of eating raw, infected
  shellfish. Cholera is endemic in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and the
  Americas.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The major cholera pandemics are generally listed as:
  First: 1817-1823, Second: 1829-1851, Third: 1852-1859, Fourth: 1863-1879,
  Fifth: 1881-1896, Sixth: 1899-1923: Seventh: 1961- 1970, and some would argue
  that we are in the Eighth: 1991 to the present. Each pandemic, save the last,
  was accompanied by many thousands of deaths. As recently as 1947, 20,500 of
  30,000 people infected in Egypt died. Despite modern medicine, cholera remains
  an efficient killer.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The second and third pandemics were enhanced by the
  concomitant Industrial Revolution, subsequent migration to the cities in
  search of jobs, and the unregulated growth of tenements and slums. Thoughts of
  supplying fresh water and removing wastes from new construction was furthest

  la capitalisme!</i>). If there were cesspools for buildings, they were only
  accessible from the ground floor. Chamber pots filled with human waste were
  emptied from windows in the upper stories, much to the displeasure of
  pedestrians who served as potential and usually rapidly moving targets. A
  sewer was no more than an extended cesspool with some provision for overflow,
  usually on one end. The excess ran into the streets or adjoining property.
  These so-called sewers had to be mucked out by hand, any dangers of methane
  poisoning or explosion notwithstanding.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Upon discovering cholera cases, most countries took
  immediate, if not altogether effective, action. England's first case was
  William Sproat of Sunderland who cast off his mortal coil on October 26, 1831.
  Officials were loath to quarantine ports or even incoming ships lest the
  emerging textile industry be harmed. The administration's spin was that there
  was no cholera in England. This remained in effect for almost twenty years.
  When in doubt, deny everything�a policy that has found its way into this
  century. Needless to say, this did little to ameliorate the extent of the
  epidemic.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">When the sixth pandemic erupted in the Middle East,
  Russia, and other parts of Europe during the summer of 1892, American
  newspapers warned of the potential spread westward. This came at a time when
  immigration into New York was at an all-time high. The strength of the Russian
  epidemic and an earlier outbreak of 200 cases of typhus amongst Russian Jews
  who had arrived on January 30 aboard the <i>S.S. Massilia</i> from Marseilles
  only compounded the problem. Jewish passengers and their American contacts
  were forcibly separated from relatives and sent to North Brother Island,
  downwind of the garbage dump on Riker's Island, in the East River near 140th
  Street. Neither cabin-class passengers nor the 470 Italian immigrants who
  shared steerage with the Russian Jews were detained. Of the 1200 detained
  Jews, fully 1150 never showed any symptoms of typhus. Nevertheless, because of
  a lack of space, most were forced to live in tents. Soap was scarce and when
  available, bathing required a dip in the frigid river. Medical care was
  totally inadequate, resulting in at least six unnecessary deaths. Not only was
  there no contact with the mainland, but the Jews were deprived of kosher food.
  Those who died were either cremated or interred in tightly sealed metal
  canisters, thus violating Jewish burial laws. Only after major protests from
  the well-established German Jewish community were regular burials and kosher
  food allowed.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Many political figures argued against unrestricted
  immigration, especially by groups with uncommon customs and costumes. A strict
  quarantine had proven effective in combating the typhus epidemic, so when the <i>S.S.
  Moravia</i> arrived from Hamburg with 22 cholera deaths, of which 20 were
  Russian children under age 10, a strict 20 day quarantine was imposed on all
  steerage passengers�but not on cabin-class passengers. Other ships brought
  more cholera and cases were found in New York City. Sans any supporting
  scientific evidence, kosher butcher shops were closed for the most trivial
  health code violations; many immigrants were evicted from their tenements and
  left to fend for themselves in the streets. Measures unrelated to the germ
  theory of disease (long after it was well known) were taken against Jewish
  immigrants, mostly at the instigation of the Surgeon General, Walter Wyman.
  Then president Benjamin Harrison was an ardent proponent of restricting
  Russian Jewish immigration, urging Congress &quot;to keep out the vicious, the
  ignorant, the civil disturber, the pauper, and the contract laborer...&quot;
  It was not a happy time for the Jewish community of New York.</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal">The mortality rate ranged from 20% to as high as 40%

  forms, <b><i>variola major</i></b> and <b><i>variola minor</i></bges/pox_hand_feet.jpg"></a></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The mortality rate ranged from 20% to as high as 40%
  depending on the age and health of the host. The disease came in two usual
  forms, <b><i>variola>, with the
  latter being less virulent and causing only a sparse rash and a low-grade
  fever. The virus is extremely stable and has not changed in, what may very
  well be, hundreds or even thousands of years. The infective dose is 1000
  virions per milliliter (essentially several drops of material sneezed or
  breathed in your direction. <i>Gesundheit!</i>). Experts claim that smallpox
  killed more than 100 million people prior to 1725.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">There are also two rare forms of smallpox: hemorrhagic
  and malignant. The first is characterized by significant subcutaneous
  bleeding. Both are usually 100% fatal if untreated.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Some early physicians believed in the process of <b><span style="color:blue">variolation</span></b>,
  whereby the pus or infected scabs of pox victims were ground up and inserted
  under the skin. Recipients of this treatment developed a mild form of the
  disease and attained a permanent resistance. Also, farmers and milkmaids
  deliberately infected themselves with cowpox because experience had taught
  them that this prevented the smallpox. Cotton Mather notified Thomas Jefferson
  of the merits of variolation and Jefferson had everyone in his household,
  freemen and slaves alike, variolated.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">In the late eighteenth century England, Edward Jenner
  noticed that milkmaids rarely came down with smallpox, but did show mild
  symptoms of the related disease cowpox. He reasoned that the cowpox caused
  immunity to the more serious disease. He concocted a mixture of extracts from
  the cowpox-infected milkmaid Sarah Nelmes and, contrary to the spirit of
  modern experimental medicine and the principle of informed consent of
  subjects, injected it into an unknowing eight year-old boy, John Phipps, on
  May 4, 1796. He found that, despite all his attempts, the boy could
  subsequently not be infected with variola. Almost two years later, he took an
  extract from the hand of Thomas Virgoe, who had been infected through contact
  with the heel of one of his mares. This was injected into one John Baker, who
  also became impervious to variola. Thus was born the smallpox vaccine. <font color="#008000">[By
  the way, vaccine comes from the Latin word <i>vacca</i>, meaning cow.]</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">As with all new discoveries, vaccination was very slow to
  take hold. Jenner had to publish the results himself, since no medical
  journals would accept it.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The disease has been &quot;completely eradicated&quot;
  after instigation from the Soviet Union before the World Health Assembly in
  1958. At that time, the disease claimed two million lives each year with cases
  in thirty-three different countries. Smallpox was &quot;eradicated&quot;
  because:</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal">The eradication program began in 1967 under the direction
  of the American Donald Henderson working for the United Nations. Each
  subsequent outbreak was attended by a cadre of experts who immunized everyone
  (whether they wanted it or not�although that frequently took quite a bit of
  diplomatic cajoling) in the area. Teams operated in times of natural
  disasters, wars, and insurrections, from Bangladesh to Sudan to Yugoslavia (it
  was a single country back then) to Ethiopia, and elsewhere.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Finally during November of 1975, a three-year-old
  Bangladeshi girl Rahima Banu was cured in the last <i>natural</i> case of
  variola major. On October 26, 1977, Ali Maow Maslin (Merka, Somalia) was the
  last (cured) case of variola minor. Unfortunately, in 1978 in Birmingham,
  England there was a major security breach in the ventilation system of a
  (supposed) BSL-2 laboratory and a photographer, Janet Parker, working upstairs
  of the lab was infected and died of smallpox. Her mother, with whom she lived,
  came down with the disease but survived. On May 8, 1980, the World Health
  Assembly formally declared the earth free of smallpox. No other cases have
  been reported since.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">There are only two stores of smallpox virus in the world
  today, the CDC BSL-4 lab in Atlanta and the Russian State Research Center of
  Virology and Biotechnology in Koltsovo, Novosibirsk. The stores were scheduled
  to be destroyed on December 31, 1996, but the US has decided against
  destruction because of the possibility of the virus's use in bio-warfare.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">In 1969, the US and the Soviet Union signed a treaty
  banning biological weapons. The US has adhered to the treaty while it has been
  reported that Russia has not. Russia is alleged to currently have several
  metric tons of freeze-dried genetically engineered hemorrhagic smallpox
  virus.&nbsp; <font color="#008000"><b>[For more details, read <i>Germs:

  <p class="MsoNormal">Influenza is caused by an orthomyxovirus that is readily
  spread by aerosol droplets. Notice the spikes sticking out of the viral
  surface.<span style="font-size:13.5pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal">The outside of the virion is covered with two kinds of
  spikes: about 500 H spikes (hemaggluttin), which work to initiate infection,
  and about 100 N spikes (neuraminidase), which release the virus from the cell
  surface and allow it to infect other cells. <span style="font-size:13.5pt;

  <p class="MsoNormal">The characteristics of the spikes change from year to
  year due to <b><span style="color:blue">antigenic shift</span></b> (an abrupt
  and large genetic change of the surface antigens) and <b><span style="color:blue">antigenic
  drift</span></b> (slow and minor genetic change). Thus, those who suffer from
  one form of flu need not gain immunity to any other form. The reservoir for
  influenza is thought to be pigs and ducks, especially in China and Southeast
  Asia.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">There are three fundamental types of flu virus, type A, B
  and C. Type A is a moderate to severe illness affecting humans and animals of
  all age groups. It is particularly susceptible to antigenic shift. Type B is a
  milder disease that affects primarily human children. Type C is so mild that
  it is rarely reported as a disease amongst humans. Hence, it has not been
  associated with an epidemics. All types of flu can experience antigenic drift.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Each type of flu is further characterized by an
  enumeration scheme for H and N, usually numbering 1, 2, or 3. But, the 1998
  avian flu in Hong Kong was listed as a Type A H5N1 and varieties up to H14 and
  N9 are known.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The disease is characterized by a sudden onset of fever,
  chills, headache, muscle aches in the neck and back, and sometimes
  prostration. Cough and sore throat are also common. Convalescence is slow and
  marked by fatigue and weakness. It is spread by discharges from the mouth and
  noses of infected persons. Young healthy adults appear to be particularly
  susceptible. There are usually more well-carriers than infected persons. The
  mortality rate is usually only as high weakness. It is spread by discharges from the mouth and
  noses of infected persons. Young healthy adults appear to b as 0.1%, but because the number
  infected is so high, there is a significant excess mortality, usually due to
  pneumonia or other pulmonary complications. In a typical year in the U.S.
  20,000 people die of flu, more specifically bacterial pneumonia secondary to
  flu. During heavy epidemic years the mortality figures can double. In the
  U.S., and most temperate climates in the northern hemisphere, the disease
  usually peaks from December to March.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Hippocrates seems to have been the first observer to
  record an influenza pandemic in the year 412 B.C. Since 1580, there have been
  thirty-one additional flu pandemics recorded.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Bad as all the previous pestilences had been, the
  twentieth century bore witness to what is arguably the most virulent epidemic
  in recorded memory. As the U.S. entered the conflict, World War I had already
  claimed nine million lives in its four-year duration. But a far greater and
  more lethal killer was lurking in Camp Funston (now Fort Riley) in Kansas.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">On the morning of March 11, 1918, Albert Mitchell, a
  company cook, reported to the infirmary complaining of a low-grade fever, sore
  throat, headache, and muscle aches�typical flu symptoms. He was sent to bed.
  By noon of that day, 107 soldiers exhibited similar symptoms and within two
  days, a total of 522 people were sick. Some were close to death with severe
  pneumonia. (Remember, there were no antibiotics in general use until the
  1950s.) Camp Funston was the tip of the iceberg as other military bases
  reported similar figures almost immediately. Even shipboard sailors docked off
  the East Coast were affected. Within a week even isolated locales were hit;
  the island of Alcatraz reported cases. No state escaped infection. Neither was
  the disease held in check by the vast expanse of ocean; by April, French
  soldiers and civilians were infected. Within two weeks, it had spread to China
  and Japan. During May it was found in Africa and South America. By this time,
  it had eased its burden of illness and death on the Americas, but continued
  its onslaught elsewhere. This first wave, somewhat more than a minor
  annoyance, was more deadly than the typical flu, but far from what was to be
  seen.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">During the autumn of 1918, likely after experiencing
  antigenic shift, the flu reappeared in the Americas. This time it seemed more
  virulent and continued to attack people in the 19-34 age group along with the
  usual population segments of children and the elderly. Fully 20% of the
  population was affected. Deaths from pneumonia were unusually high. At
  military camps bodore
  virulent and continued to attack peoplies could not be autopsied fast enough that the dead were
  piled like so much cordwood in storerooms. The civilian population was also
  decimated. Medical personnel were unable to offer more than palliative care.
  Some medical authorities claimed the cause was &quot;Pfeiffer's bacillus&quot;
  and recommended wearing gauze masks to prevent its spread. Schools and public
  places were closed. Many cities mandated the wearing of masks and levied fines
  of $5 on those who failed to comply.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The disease's effect on military age men was so great
  that the American draft was suspended in October of 1918 due to the epidemic.
  As the Allies engaged Germany in a series of &quot;final&quot; offensives, the
  flu was a major player in the overall mortality rate and swung the outcome of
  some battles. Even General Pershing, the commander of the American
  Expeditionary Force (AEF, impolitely referred to as ass-end-first by the
  common foot soldier) was affected. So many soldiers died of it, that the flu
  had a significant influence on the cessation of hostilities. The AEF suffered
  35,000 battle-related casualties and 9,000 deaths from flu. Of course, this
  means that many, many more soldiers had been unable to fight because of the
  disabling disease. Even the peace conference at Versailles was affected as all
  three major participants, President Woodrow Wilson of the United States, Prime
  Minister David Lloyd George of Great Britain, and Premier Georges Clemenceau
  of France, contracted the disease and this likely changed the outcome of the
  negotiations.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The disease was generally called the <i>Spanish flu</i>
  (for no good reason other than announcements of its effect first came from the
  relatively open country of Spain), although Germans called it the French flu
  and the French called it the German flu, etc. The old familiar xenophobia
  anyone?</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">About eighteen months after its first appearance, the
  disease disappeared. At its height, mortality rates were 15.8% in
  Philadelphia, 14.8% in Baltimore, and 10.9% in Washington D.C. Sixty percent
  of the Inuit population in Nome, Alaska fell victim to the flu. Although
  overall death rates were relatively low, the incidence rate was abnormally
  high at around 20% of the population. Almost everyone in this country knew of
  someone who had succumbed to the flu. Between 80% and 90% of the Western
  Samoan population (under the governance of New Zealand) was infected. The U.S.
  death toll was 650,000�low by worldwide standards; Russia lost 450,000;
  Italy 375,000; Britain 228,000; 500,000 in Mexico; 44,000 in Canada;
  unnumbered millions died in the Asian subcontinent. Estimates of the worldwide
  mortality for this epidemic range from 25 million to 50 million. The unusual
  feature of this epidemic was the age-mortality curve: flu usually kills young
  children and the elderly, but this version also took a large proportion of
  males between 19 and 34. Compared to the Plague of the Middle Ages with its
  eight to thirteen million dead globally per year, this may have been the most
  lethal recorded epidemic in human history.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">December of 1997 saw a minor eruption of an avian flu in
  Hong Kong. In the manner of Falstaff's suggestion for curing the ills of
  society, they began by killing all the chickens. As of January 1, 2001, it has
  not been incontrovertibly established that that variant of the disease can be
  spread from human-to-human, although there may have been one or two such
  cases.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">During September of 2001 it was announced that the full
  genome of the 1918 flu had been decoded and the protein that caused its
  virulence had been discovered. It was an H1N1 flu. The story of the search for
  samples of the virus is told in Gina Kolata�s book ***<span style="font-size:

  <p class="MsoNormal">Most childhood diseases evolved from more malign strains
  that attacked, what was then, a naive population. As decades passed and
  resistance developed among the populace, the virulence of the pathogen
  decreased, and the disease was relegated to the least resistant hosts,
  children.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Measles, along with smallpox, were the likely villains in
  the virtual extermination of the Amerindians. Cortez's initial foray into the
  New World might have met with disaster were it not for these diseases. After
  their first military encounter with Montezuma's armies, Cortez's forces were
  outnumbered and soundly defeated. Awaiting a second attack from the Aztecs
  that into the
  New World might have met with disaster were it not for these diseases. After
would wipe out his entire troop, he was reinforced with men from
  smallpox-ridden Cuba, including a slave with a mild case of the disease. Once

  native allies, only to find most of the population dead, dying, or gone.
  Montezuma and his son had died, thus causing a small civil war over the
  succession. Corpses were everywhere; even the famous Aztec canals were filled
  with the dead. The pox reached the Mayas before the Spanish. This and other
  diseases swept through the continent like wildfire in dry grass on a windy
  day. From an estimated population of 25�30 million, only 3 million survived
  in Mexico. The Inca population plummeted from 8 million to one million. After
  all forms of European &quot;germ warfare,&quot; the Amerindian population was
  reduced to about 5% of what it was before &quot;discovery&quot; of the New
  World. The most extreme estimates are of 130 million indigenous people living
  in Central and South America before the new diseases and a mere 1.6 million
  after!</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal">Diseases like measles and mumps that ravaged virgin
  populations are now rarely lethal for even the most susceptible human hosts.
  What were once fatal epidemic diseases are now simply childhood annoyances.
  These diseases attack only those with the least well-developed immune systems,
  young children. The microbes and their hosts have coevolved and adapted to a
  form of equilibrium. A truce has been called�at least temporarily.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Infectious diseases must be closely watched and
  appropriately feared; as the past has taught us, humility is a far greater
  virtue than either arrogance or hubris when it comes to dealing with Nature.</p>
