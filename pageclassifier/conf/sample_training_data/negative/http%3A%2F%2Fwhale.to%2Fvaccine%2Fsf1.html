<p><b><font size="4">CHAPTER 2<span lang="en-gb">: </span>THE SPANISH INFLUENZA EPIDEMIC OF 1918 WAS CAUSED BY
VACCINATIONS</font></b></p>

<p>As has been stated before, all medical and non-medical authorities on vaccination agree
that vaccines are designed to cause a mild case of the diseases they are supposed to
prevent. But they also know and admit that there is no way whatsoever to predict whether
the case will be mild or severe - even deadly. With this much uncertainty in dealing with
the very lives of people, it is very unscientific and extremely dangerous to use such a
questionable procedure as vaccination.</p>

<p>Many vaccines also cause other diseases besides the one for which they are given. For
instance, smallpox vaccine often causes syphilis, paralysis, leprosy, and cancer. (See the
chapters on smallpox and plagues.) Polio shots, diphtheria toxin-antitoxin, typhoid
vaccine, as well as measles, tetanus and all other shots often cause various other stages
of disease such as post-vaccinal encephalitis (inflammation of the brain,) paralysis,
spinal meningitis, blindness, cancer (sometimes within two years,) tuberculosis, (two to
twenty years after the shot,) arthritis, kidney disease, heart disease (heart failure
sometimes within minutes after the shot and sometimes several hours later.) Nerve damage
and many other serious conditions also follow the injections.</p>

<p>When several shots are given (different vaccines) within a few days or a few weeks
apart, they often trigger intensified cases of all the diseases at once, because the body
cannot handle such a large amount of deadly poison being injected directly into the
bloodstream. The doctors call it a new disease and proceed to suppress the symptoms.</p>

<p>When poison is taken by the mouth, the internal defense system has a chance to quickly
eject some of it by vomiting, but when the poisons are shot directly into the body,
bypassing all the natural safeguards, these dangerous poisons circulate immediately
throughout the entire body in a matter of seconds and keep on circulating until all the
cells are poisoned.</p>

<p>I heard that <i>seven men dropped dead in a doctor&#146;s office after being
vaccinated. </i>This was in an army camp, so I wrote to the Government for verification.
They sent me the report of U.S. Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson. The report not only
verified the report of the seven who dropped dead from the vaccines, but it stated that
there had been 63 deaths and 28,585 cases of hepatitis as a direct result of the yellow
fever vaccine during only 6 months of the war. That was only one of the 14 to 25 shots
given the soldiers. We can imagine the damage that all these shots did to the men. (See
the chapter on What Vaccinations Did to Our Soldiers.)</p>

<p>The first World War was of a short duration, so the vaccine makers were unable to use
up all their vaccines. As they were (and still are) in business for profit, they decided
to sell it to the rest of the population. So they drummed up the largest vaccination
campaign in U.S. history. There were no epidemics to justify it so they used other tricks.
Their propaganda claimed the soldiers were coming home from foreign countries with all
kinds of diseases and that everyone must have all the shots on the market.</p>

<p>The people believed them because, first of all, they wanted to believe their doctors,
and second, the returning soldiers certainly had been sick. They didn&#146;t know it was
from doctor-made vaccine diseases, as the army doctors don&#146;t tell them things like
that. Many of the returned soldiers were disabled for life by these drug-induced diseases.
Many were insane from postvaccinal encephalitis, but the doctors called it <i>shell shock,
</i>even though many had never left American soil.</p>

<p>The <i>conglomerate </i>disease brought on by the many poison vaccines baffled the
doctors, as they never had a vaccination spree before which used so many different
vaccines. The new disease they had created had symptoms of all the diseases they had
injected into the man. There was the high fever, extreme weakness, abdominal rash and
intestinal disturbance characteristic of typhoid. The diphtheria vaccine caused lung
congestion, chills and fever, swollen, sore throat clogged with the false membrane, and
the choking suffocation because of difficulty in breathing followed by gasping and death,
after which the body turned black from stagnant blood that had been deprived of oxygen in
the suffocation stages. In early days they called it <i>Black Death. </i>The other
vaccines cause their own reactions &#151; paralysis, brain damage, lockjaw, etc.</p>

<p>When doctors had tried to suppress the symptoms of the typhoid with a stronger vaccine,
it caused a worse form of typhoid which they named <i>paratyphoid. </i>But when they
concocted a stronger and more dangerous vaccine to suppress that one, they created an even
worse disease which they didn&#146;t have a name for. What should they call it? They
didn&#146;t want to tell the people what it really was &#151; their own Frankenstein
monster which they had created with their vaccines and suppressive medicines. They wanted
to direct the blame away from themselves, so they called it <i>Spanish Influenza. </i>It
was certainly not of Spanish origin, and the Spanish people resented the implication that
the world-wide scourge of that day should be blamed on them. But the name stuck and
American medical doctors and vaccine makers were not suspected of the crime of this
widespread devastation &#151; the <i>1918 Flu Epidemic. </i>It is only in recent years
that researchers have been digging up the facts and laying the blame where it belongs.</p>

<p>Some of the soldiers may have been in Spain before coming home, but their diseases
originated in their own home-based U.S. Army Camps. Our medical men still use that same
dodge. When their own vaccines (required for travel) cause vaccine diseases abroad they
use this as grounds for a scare campaign to stampede people into the vaccination centers.
Do you remember the Hong Kong Flu and the Asian Flu and the London Flu scares? These were
all medically-made epidemics mixed with the usual common colds which people have every
year.</p>

<p>Now (1976) we are being worked on again by the vaccine -epidemic makers in their effort
to force another multi million dollar vaccine sale caper. Their con men have already
talked President Ford into handing over <i>$135 </i>million dollars to start their vaccine
racket. Even the insurance companies refused to become involved with such an obviously
dangerous and crooked scheme. So, again the medical and drug con men induced the
appropriate government officials to guarantee insurance against the, possible billions of
dollars in law suits which could be brought against the vaccine promoters if the vaccine
campaign is carried out as planned. It&#146;s a good thing Ford was voted out of office.
It&#146;s too bad he wasn&#146;t &quot;dumped&quot; <i>before </i>he paid the <i>poison
squad </i>the MONEY&#146; to poison the whole population. However, we don&#146;t yet know
if President Carter will be any better. Will he be held in the grip of the medical and
drug dictatorship? Or will he investigate &#151; learn the truth &#151; <i>reverse the
decisions </i>and make the vaccine makers return the money taken from the taxpayers under
false pretenses?</p>

<p>The statement of the swine flu vaccine promoters to the effect that the vaccine is
harmless, is false, and the statement that it will protect against flu is false. Fifty-six
people died after the shots, some within 48 hours. There is confusion and disagreement
among the doctors about all aspects of the vaccine, from the safety and effectiveness to
the necessity for it, who should have it and who should be warned against it.</p>

<p>Their scare-head campaign cry is that the swine flu is like the 1918 flu which killed
20,000,000 people. They don&#146;t have any usable and provable blood samples from the
1918 flu epidemic to prove it. That was 58 years ago, and the doctors were just as
confused and inefficient then as now. However, one thing is certain &#151; the 1918
Spanish Influenza was a vaccine-induced disease caused by extreme body poisoning from the
conglomeration of many different vaccines. The soldiers at Fort Dix who were said to have
had Swine Flu had been injected with a large variety of vaccines like the vaccines which
caused the 1918 flu epidemic. The flu epidemic at Fort Dix was in no way related to swine.
There were no swine at camp (unless we want to sarcastically call the vaccine promoters
who caused the diseases -&quot;swine.&quot;)</p>

<p>To add to the confusion, the doctors tell the people that there are a lot of various
kinds of flu; the one which the soldiers at Fort Dix had was AVictoria flu, there are
other strains of flu virus, and also, that the swine flu vaccine which so many people have
taken already will not protect them against the many other types of flu. This will be used
as an &quot;out&quot; in case <i>of </i>law suits later on when more casualties begin to
show up. The doctors will say that the vaccine failed because it was the wrong kind of flu
for the vaccine. Of course, no one can prove it one way or the other because viruses are
illusive, invisible organisms which are unstable and unpredictable. One dictionary
definition of virus is &quot;a morbid poison.&quot; The vaccines injected into the body
are poison and cause the typical poison reactions. Virus (poison) does not fly around and
attack people.</p>

<p>Therefore, <i>there will be no swine flu epidemic unless the vaccine promoters make one
like they did in the 1918 flu epidemic. </i>It will not kill 20,000,000 people unless the
people submit to the disease-producing shots. There are also, other causes of disease
besides vaccines, such as bad food, which has been devitalized and contaminated with
poison preservatives and artificial drug concoctions. There are many more causes of
disease but no diseases are contagious(See the chapter on the germ theory).</p>

<p>Vaccine drives come and go as often as the vaccine promoters can cook up the slightest
pretense of a reason.n Back in1957 they were trying to stir up a vaccination campaign for
what they decided to call <i>Asiatic flu. </i>An editorial in the <i>Herald and Express </i>for
August 29, 1957 was captioned, &quot;Fear of Flu Propaganda.&quot; Part of the piece is as
follows:</p>

<p>&quot;What a tempest in a teapot has been blown up over the probability that this
country will experience an epidemic of the <i>Asiatic flu </i>in the fall and winter
months ahead.</p>

<p>&quot;Even the United States Department of Health is stooge for the panic &#151; and
has issued statements which are frightening the public, rather than reassuring them by
pointing out that this epidemic, while widespread, gives no indication of being any more
dangerous than our usual flood of influenza-like colds when winter comes on.</p>

<p>&quot;Those who read between the lines even wonder whether the whole thing might not be
a bit of super salesmanship on the part of those who are making and selling the vaccines
which are being prepared.. . .&quot;</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;I WAS AN ON-THE-SPOT OBSERVER OF THE 1918 INFLUENZA EPIDEMIC</strong></p>

<p>All the doctors and people who were living at the time of the 1918 Spanish Influenza
epidemic say it was the most terrible disease the world has ever had. Strong men, hale and
hearty, one day would be dead the next. The disease had the characteristics of the black
death added to typhoid, diphtheria, pneumonia, smallpox, paralysis and all the diseases
the people had been vaccinated with immediately following World War 1. Practically the
entire population had been injected &quot;seeded&quot; with a dozen or more diseases
&#151; or toxic serums. When all those doctor-made diseases started breaking out all at
oncle had been vaccinated with immediately following World War 1. Practically e it was tragic.</p>

<p>That pandemic dragged on for two years, kept alive with the addition of more poison
drugs administered by the doctors who tried to suppress the symptoms. As far as I could
find out, the flu hit only the vaccinated. Those who had refused the shots escaped the
flu. My family had refused all the vaccinations so we remained well all the time. We knew
from the health teachings of Graham, Trail, Tilden and others, that people cannot
contaminate the body with poisons without causing disease.</p>

<p>When the flu was at its peak, all the stores were closed as well as the schools,
businesses &#151; even the hospital, as the doctors and nurses had been vaccinated too and
were down with the flu. No one was on the streets. It was like a ghost town. We seemed to
be the only family which didn&#146;t get the flu; so my parents went from house to house
doing what they could to look after the sick, as it was impossible to get a doctor then.
If it were possible for germs, bacteria, virus, or bacilli to cause disease, they had
plenty of opportunity to attack my parents when they were spending many hours a day in the
sick rooms. But they didn&#146;t get the flu and they didn&#146;t bring any germs home to
attack us children and cause anything. None of our family had the flu &#151; not even a
sniffle&#151; and it was in the winter with deep snow on the ground.</p>

<p>When I see people cringe when someone near them sneezes or coughs, I wonder how long it
will take them to find out that they can&#146;t catch it &#151; whatever it is. The only
way they can get a disease is to develop it themselves by wrong eating, drinking, smoking
or doing some other things which cause internal poisoning and lowered vitality. All
diseases are preventable and most of them are cureable with the right methods, not known
to medical doctors, and not all drugless doctors know them either.</p>

<p>It has been said that the 1918 flu epidemic killed 20,000,000 people throughout the
world. But, actually, the doctors killed them with their crude and deadly treatments and
drugs. This is a harsh accusation but it is nevertheless true, judging by the success of
the drugless doctors in comparison with that of the medical doctors.</p>

<p>While the medical men and medical hospitals were losing 33% of their flu cases, the
non-medical hospitals such as BATTLE CREEK, KELLOGG and MACFADDEN&#146;S HEALTH-RESTORIUM
were getting almost 100% healings with their <i>water </i>cure, baths, enemas, etc.,
fasting and certain other simple healing methods, followed by carefully worked out diets
of natural foods. One health doctor didn&#146;t lose a patient in eight years. The very
successful health treatment of one of those drugless doctors who didn&#146;t lose any
patients will be given in the other part of this book, titled VACCINATION CONDEMNED, to be
published a little later.</p>

<p>If the medical doctors had been as advanced as the drugless doctors, there would not
have been those 20 million deaths from the medical flu treatment.</p>

<p>There was seven times more disease among the vaccinated soldiers than among the
unvaccinated civilians, and the diseases were those they had been vaccinated against. One
soldier who had returned from overseas in 1912 told me that the army hospitals were filled
with cases of <i>infantile paralysis</i> and he wondered why grown men should have an
infant disease. Now, we know that paralysis is a common after-effect of vaccine poisoning.
Those at home didn&#146;t get the paralysis until after the world-wide vaccination
campaign in 1918.</p>
