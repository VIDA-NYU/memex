				<div class="entry">
										<p>Whooping cough is the colloquial name for pertussis it is also called the &#8220;100 day cough&#8221; in areas of Asia. The coughing leads to loss of breath followed by a sharp intake, which creates the whooping sound that characterizes this disease. Pertussis occurs worldwide. In 2012 nearly 50 thousand cases were recorded in the United States, most occurring in infants. Whooping cough outbreaks occur cyclically with peak infection rates occurring in two to five year intervals. Transmission occurs between infected individuals through the air. The bacteria may be transmitted through breathing, talking, or coughing. Whooping cough is most severe in infants and young children; there is a 2% mortality rate in this population. In adults and older children, treatment with antibiotics usually results in a full recovery. Pertussis is easily prevented with readily available vaccines.<br />

<h2>Whooping cough cause</h2>
<p>Pertussis is caused by the Bordetella pertussis bacterium. The bacterium can be spread through the air as infected individuals breath, cough, or sneeze. Infected individuals are contagious for as long as three weeks after the initial onset of symptoms, and it is possible to spread whooping cough before one is aware that one is ill. Pregnant women with whooping cough may also give it to their unborn baby.</p>
<h2>Whooping cough symptoms</h2>
<p>The <a title="Symptoms of Whooping Cough" href="http://whoopingcough-symptoms.com/symptoms-of-whooping-cough/">symptoms of whooping cough</a> are initially similar to those of the common cold. An initial catarrhal stage causes a runny nose, sneezing, congestion, and/or fever. Paroxysmal or severe coughing presents one to two weeks after the catarrhal stage. The coughing is typically violent and rapid. After a cough, air is forced out of the lung and the following inspiration causes the whooping sound, which gives the illness its name. Vomiting may also occur due to the intensity of coughing, and clear sputum may be produced. In babies, the coughing may not be easily observable, but noticeable apneas or breathing pauses will occur. The paroxysmal coughing stage lasts for two to eight weeks before transitioning into the convalescent stage. The convalescent stage brings a decreased frequency and intensity of coughing as well as a reduction in vomiting. Eventually all symptoms subside. Individuals may be infected many times, the body does not develop a lifelong immunity.</p>
<p>When coughing occurs it may be difficult to control and may interfere with the affected individual&#8217;s ability to eat, drink, or sleep. Coughing occurs more often at night. In young children and babies, the coughing may interfere with breathing, leading to red, blue, or purple faces. If the apnea is extremely severe, the baby may not receive enough oxygen, resulting in the potential for brain damage. In babies whose mothers were not vaccinated, complicating symptoms such as pneumonia or encephalopathy can occur. Other potential complications include earache and seizures. Most otherwise healthy adults and older children will make full recoveries; however, those with other conditions have an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Due to the strenuous and severe intensity of the coughing, there is a risk of bruised or cracked ribs, abdominal hernias, and broken blood vessels in the eyes and throat.</p>
<p>Whooping cough in newborns is extremely dangerous as pertussis infections are fatal in 1.6% of infants under one year of age. Infants are also more prone to complications with 20% developing pneumonia, 0.3% developing encephalopathy, and 1% developing seizures.</p>
<h2>Diagnosis</h2>
<p>Due to the similarity between the symptoms of pertussis and the symptoms of other respiratory illnesses like flu, cold, and bronchitis, it may be difficult to accurately diagnose. A skilled clinician will diagnose pertussis by listening to the sound of the cough and inquiring about associated symptoms. Occasionally, the doctor will also check for evidence of Bordetella pertussis bacterium in nose or throat swabs.</p>
<h2>Whooping cough vaccination</h2>
<p>Vaccination is the main method of prevention for pertussis. The DTaP vaccine is recommended by the CDC and combines diphtheria, tetanus, and <a title="Whooping Cough Vaccine" href="http://whoopingcough-symptoms.com/whooping-cough-vaccine/">pertussis vaccines</a>. 89 out of 100 children who receive the DTaP vaccine will have protection from pertussis. Some children will still get pertussis, but their symptoms will be greatly diminished. The DTaP vaccine loses efficacy over time and booster shots are available.</p>
<p>It is highly recommended that pregnant women receive a TdaP (tetanus and pertussis) vaccine near the beginning of their third trimester for every pregnancy. The vaccine causes the mothers body to produce antibodies that can help to prevent some of the complications of whooping cough.</p>
<p>It is also recommended that individuals who are frequently in contact with children receive the whooping cough vaccine. No repeat vaccination is required for individuals who received the TdaP vaccination before 19 years of age, and no booster is required. Adults who did not receive a TdaP vaccination as a teen should get one dose. The vaccine should be received at least two weeks before contact with children to give the body time to produce a sufficient number of antibodies.</p>
<p>After a baby is born he/she requires booster shots. For DTaP, five doses in total should be administered at various ages. Babies remain susceptible to pertussis until the third vaccination so those six months or younger are at very high risk of infection. Common side effects of the DTaP vaccination are redness and swelling at the site of the shot, fever, and vomiting. More rare side effects may include severe fever, crying for greater than three hours, or seizures.</p>
<h2>The whooping cough treatment</h2>
<p>If an individual becomes infected with pertussis, he or she will typically be <a title="Whoopin, and vomiting. More rare side effects may include severe fever, crying for greater than three hours, or seizures.</p>
<h2>The whooping cough treatment</h2>
<p>If an individual becomes infected with pertussis, he or she will typically be <a title="g Cough Treatment" href="http://whoopingcough-symptoms.com/whooping-cough-treatment/">treated with antibiotics</a>. Erythromycin and azithromycin are generally the first treatments choice, but macrolides, a newer type of antibiotic, may also be preferred due its decreased risk of side effects. If the individual is allergic to first treatment antibiotics or macrolides, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) may be administered instead.<br />

For adults and older children, appropriate rest and plenty of liquids are important parts of the recovery regimen. For babies or younger children, treatment will include isolation from others to prevent transmission between babies. Unfortunately, cough medicines are often ineffective in the face of pertussis and may not offer relief of the symptoms. All prescribed antibiotics should be taken until finished even if symptoms are diminished or gone. The doctor should be contacted immediately if seizures, troubled breathing, high fever, or hernias occur. If the infected person is unable to keep food down, an intravenous line may be used.</p>
