<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Etiologic agent:</b>&nbsp; <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> (1)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Transmission</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Cholera is transmitted by the fecal oral route.&nbsp; The most 
common way that people become infected with cholera is by drinking water 
contaminated with the feces of a person with <i>V. cholerae. </i>Outbreaks often 
occur in areas with poor sewage and drinking water sanitization.<i> V. cholerae</i> 
also lives coastal waters and can attach to crustaceans called copepods.&nbsp; 
Copepods feed on algae and will follow their food source More algae means more 
copepods, which means more <i>V cholerae</i> in the water.&nbsp; Also, shellfish 
filter a lot of water which can concentrate bacterial cells in their body.&nbsp; 
These shellfish can cause infection in people when they are eaten, and this is 
the cause of most cases contracted in America when the shellfish originate from 
an endemic cholera area.&nbsp; In areas where cholera is endemic it can also be 
transmitted through raw fruits and vegetables, since the water and fertilizer 
used to grow the crops are often contaminated with <i>V. cholerae</i>.&nbsp; Because 
more than a million bacteria are needed to cause illness, cholera is not 
normally transmitted through casual person to person contact. (5)&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Resevoirs</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The natural reservoir for <i>V. cholerae</i> was thought 
for a long time to be humans, but evidence now supports that the reservoir is 
the aquatic environment. (3)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>General characteristics of <i>V. cholerae</i></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">V. cholerae is a gram-negative rod which has a single polar 
flagellum for motility. &nbsp;It is oxidase positive which distinguishes it from 
enterics, and can be oxidative or fermentative in their metablolism, which 
distinguishes it from pseudomonads.(3)&nbsp; The microorganism is the source of the 
cholera infection, but the effects of the disease are attributable to the very 
potent enterotoxin called cholera toxin or CTX.&nbsp; This toxin interferes with the 
normal flow of sodium and chloride in the intestinal wall causing the body to 
secrete huge amounts of water and electrolytes.&nbsp; This is the cause for the 
diarrhea that is associated with the illness.(5) </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Key tests for identification</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Because the signs and symptoms of severe cholera are 
unmistakable in endemic areas, the only way to confirm the diagnosis is to 
identify the bacteria in the stool sample. (5)&nbsp; Dipsticks are now available for 
rapid diagnosis.&nbsp; Since the areas which are endemic for cholera are usuallylera are 
unmistakable in endemic areas, the only way to confirm the diagnosis is to 
identify the bacteria in the stool sample. (5)&nbsp; Dipsticks are now available for 
rapid  not 
located next to clinical laboratories, the test is easy to transport and 
requires little to no training to use.&nbsp; The test is based on the principle of 
immunochromatography, and all you do is immerse the dipstick into a stool sample 
and wait 2-15 minutes.&nbsp; If two red lines appear then the test is positive for <i>
V. cholerae</i>. (2)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Signs and symptoms</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Most people exposed to <i>V. cholerae </i>never become ill, 
but can still transmit the bacteria through their feces. Most people who become 
sick with cholera only experience mild diarrhea which is hard to distinguish 
from run of the mill diarrhea. About 10% of people infected with cholera 
experience the typical signs and symptoms associated with the disease. The main 
sign of cholera is severe watery diarrhea. The diarrhea is often a milky color 
and resembles water which rice has been rinsed with.&nbsp; The person may also 
experience nausea, muscle cramps, dehydration, and shock.&nbsp; The shock which 
people may experience is attributable to the dehydration, and it is the most 
serious affect.&nbsp; Shock can cause death within minutes.&nbsp; Children with cholera 
have the same symptoms as adults, but may also experience extreme drowsiness or 
coma, fever, and convulsions. (5)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Historical information</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Descriptions of cholera date back to Hippocrates and 
Sanskrit writings.&nbsp; Epidemic cholera was described by Garcia del Huerto, a 
Portugese physician in India, in 1563.&nbsp; In 1849 John Snow proved water as a mode 
of transmission for cholera, and in 1883 Robert Koch isolated the cholera vibrio 
from the feces of patients, proving it as the causative agent. (3) Cholera was 
simply endemic in most of the world before sewage and water sanitization, and 
still is endemic in parts of the world without proper sanitization.&nbsp; The first 
long distance spread of cholera began in 1817 with the spread of cholera from 
Europe to the Americas.&nbsp; Since the first long-distance spread of cholera until 
the early twentieth century six waves of cholera devastated the world in 
epidemic fashion.&nbsp; In 1961 a more virulent strand of cholera called El Tor 
emerged which ravaged the Phillipines and was known as the seventh global 
pandemic.&nbsp; El Tor also emerged again in Peru in 1991 killing 9642 people and 
infecting 1,041,422.&nbsp; Cholera was prevalent in the 1800s in America, but has 
been virtually eliminated with modern sewage and water treatments the seventh global 
pandemic.&nbsp; El Tor.&nbsp; 90% of cases 
of cholera are due to traveling abroad, and most of the other cases are due to 
eating shellfish from endemic areas. (3)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Virulence factors</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Cholera has two factors which contribute most greatly to 
its virulence.&nbsp; First is the protein TCP pili, which allows the microorganism to 
adhere to the mucosa in the intestines.&nbsp; The TCP pili also allows the 
microorganism to clump together.&nbsp; Another virulence factor is the CTX toxin, 
which is attributable to viral DNA being added to the bacteria.&nbsp; The viral DNA 
which gives the bacteria the toxin also tells the bacteria to multiply like 
crazy when the bacteria is in the intestines. (6)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Control/Treatment</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The World Health Organization has established guidelines 
for the treatment of cholera, in which the goal is to replace lost body fluids 
by using Oral Rehydration Salts.&nbsp; The Oral Rehydration Salts contain a specific 
mixture of salts, sugars, and water, and are available in powder form.&nbsp; The 
powder is then mixed with water that has been boiled and given to the patient. 
(5) </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Prevention</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The best way to prevent contacting cholera is to wash you 
hands, avoid untreated water, avoid raw or undercooked food, be wary of fruits 
and vegetables in endemic areas, and be wary of dairy food in endemic areas.&nbsp; 
There is no vaccine for cholera available in America, because the traditional 
injected vaccines offered minimal protection against the disease. (5) In other 
countries there is an oral cholera vaccine (OCV) that has been proven safe and 
effective 85-90% after six months in all age groups, and drops to 62% after 1 
year.&nbsp; It is administered in 2 doses 10 to 15 days apart and given with 150 mL 
of safe water.&nbsp; Since 2006 the WHO has carried out several immunization 
campaigns. (1)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Current outbreaks locally</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The last outbreak of cholera in the United States occurred 
in 1911.(5)&nbsp; However there are sporadic cases of which 90% are attributable to 
travel and most of the other cases are due to seafood from endemic areas. (3)&nbsp; 
In America approximately 1 in 45,333,334 catch cholera, and there were 6 
notified cases in 1999. (7)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
< 90% are attributable to 
travel and most ofp class="MsoNormal"><b>Current outbreaks globally</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Cholera is endemic in much of&nbsp; Asia, the Middle East, Latin 
America, and particularly in India and Sub-Saharan Africa. (5)&nbsp; In 2005 there 
were 131,933 reported cases of cholera and 2272 deaths.&nbsp; 14 countries accounted 
for 58% of the reported cases and Africa reported 125,082 of the cases.&nbsp; (1)</p>
