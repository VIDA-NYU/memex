<h4>How Polio Works</h4>
The virus enters through a person's mouth, multiplies in the intestines 
and targets the nervous system. Travelling along nerve fibers, the 
virus destroys motor neurons, resulting in muscle failure. The legs are 
most often affected. In the most severe cases, the muscles of the torso 
are affected; without working muscles, one can not breathe.<p>

Initial symptoms include fever, tiredness, vomiting and headache.  Within
hours of becoming infected, the person can become irreversibly paralyzed.
This happens in about 1 out of every 200 infections. Among those who
become paralyzed, about 5-10% die because the muscles involved in
breathing can not function.  The disease is spread from person-to-person;
poor hygiene and sanitation contributes to the spread of polio as an
infected person excretes the virus in feces.</td></tr></table>

<h3>A Brief History</h3> Nowadays, people in the US rarely think of polio,
an infectious disease caused by a virus. Just 50 years ago, however, the
virus was a real threat to children (mainly under the age of 5), causing
thousands of children to become paralyzed.  Many people died from polio.
Children with paralyzed legs used wheelchairs, braces or crutches to get
around. Parents would not allow their children to swim in natural swimming
holes or rock quarries out of fear that the polio virus might lurk there.
A real sense of panic set in every summer, when the number of cases rose
sharply in the US (and Western Europe). Huge mechanical contraptions
called <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_lung">iron lungs</a>
were used to assist breathing in those whose paralysis involved the torso.  
There is no cure for polio, making prevention the key in beating this
highly infectious virus.<p>

<h3>Vaccine Development</h3>
In the mid-1950s, <a href =
"http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/sal0bio-1">Dr. Jonas Salk</a>
lysis involved the torso.  
There is no cure developed an injectable polio vaccine (IPV) from the inactivated (killed)
virus.  A few years later, <a href=
"http://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/about/history/sabin.htm">Dr.  Albert
Sabin</A> developed an oral polio vaccine (OPV) from a "live" virus.  
This became the vaccine of choice worldwide because it is <strong>less
<img src = "./gif/ironlung.jpg" align=left vspace=15 hspace=15>
expensive</strong>, <strong>easier to give</strong> (no needle or trained
health caregiver needed) and <strong>rapidly stops the spread</strong> of
polio. The only disadvantage is that in rare cases, perhaps 1 out of every
2.5 million doses, the vaccine gives the recipient polio.<P>

<h3>Polio:  Defeated in the US</h3>
As a result of this vaccine-induced polio, in 2000 the US government
stopped using the "live" virus vaccine. Since using IVP, the last US case
of vaccine-related polio was documented in 1999, according to a study
published in the <I>Journal of the American Medical Association</I>.

<h3>A Global Perspective</h3>

More work worldwide is still needed to stamp out polio completely. The
goal of the <a href= "http://www.polioeradication.org/">Global Polio
Eradication Initiative</A>, a joint effort by the WHO, Rotary
International, the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and UNICEF, is to
have <strong>zero</strong> new cases of polio by 2005. Since 1988, when
the Initww.polioeradication.org/">Global Polio
Eradication Initiative</A>, a joint effort by the WHO, Rotary
International, the US Centers for Disease Controliative started, the number of polio cases worldwide has dropped
99%.

<h3>The Numbers Tell A Tale of Progress</h3>
As recently as 1988, more than 125 countries on five continents
were home to the polio virus, resulting in more than 1,000 children per
day becoming paralyzed. In 1988, there were 350,000 cases worldwide; by
2002, thanks to vaccination efforts, the worldwide count was down to 
around 1900 cases.<p>

<h3>Future Work</h3>
Polio is still a threat to children in seven countries in sub-Saharan 
Africa and south Asia. As of November 24, 2004, there were a total of 683 cases 
in Nigeria, 91 in India, 40 in Pakistan and 21 in Niger. There were a few 
cases in Afghanistan and Egypt.<P>
