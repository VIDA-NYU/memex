<h2><a name="DifKinOrgSalSys">1. Different Kinds of Organ Sale System</a></h2>

<p>
The expression &lsquo;organ sale&rsquo; covers a wide range of different practices.  People most readily associate it with the case in which one individual (who needs or wants money) sells his or her kidney to another (who needs a kidney).  But there are other possibilities too.  One (in countries where the prior consent of the deceased is required for cadaveric organ donation) is to pay people living now for rights over their body after death.  Another (in countries where the consent of relatives is required for cadaveric organ donation) is to pay relatives for transplant rights over their recently deceased loved ones' bodies. 
</p>

<p>
Since the kidney is the most commonly transplanted organ and since the ethics literature on organ sale is mainly about kidney sale from live donors, that is the practice on which this entry will focus.  &lsquo;Organ sale&rsquo; as the term is used here does not include the sale of body <em>products</em> (a category which includes blood, eggs, hair, and sperm) since this is different in some important respects.  For example, the risk of permanent harm is generally much less in the case of blood and hair donation; while, the donation of eggs and sperm raises additional issues relating to the creation and parenting of additis different in some important respects.  For onal future people.  That said, many of the fundamental issues are similar and the very same concerns about (for example) exploitation and consent arise in both cases.
</p>

<p>
An important preliminary point is that almost all serious advocates of
allowing payment for human organs argue not for an unfettered
&lsquo;free market&rsquo; but for a regulated one.  Radcliffe Richards
et al. (1998, 1950) for example, in their paper &ldquo;The Case for
Allowing Kidney Sales&rdquo; say:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It must be stressed that we are not arguing for the positive conclusion
that organ sales must always be acceptable, let alone that there should
be an <em>unfettered</em> market.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
While Wilkinson (2003, 132) is typical of organ sale defenders in wishing to distance himself from today's (largely &lsquo;underground&rsquo;) organ trade:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
&hellip; far from being a reason to continue the ban on sale, the dreadfulness of present practice may be a reason to <em>discontinue</em> prohibition, so that the organ trade can be brought &lsquo;overground&rsquo; and properly regulated.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Different scholars have different views about the precise scope and extent of the regulation required, but most support the requirements that organ sellers give valid consent, are paid a reasonable fee, and are provided with adequat</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Different scholars have different views about the precise scope and extent of the regulation required, but most support the reqe medical care.  Taylor (2005, 110) for example, says that:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
At minimum &hellip; a market should require that vendors give their informed consent to the sale of their kidneys, that they not be coerced into selling their kidneys by a third party and that they receive adequate post-operative care.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
One noteworthy policy proposal comes from Erin and Harris (1994; 2003) who suggest that a market in human organs should have the following features:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
It is limited to a particular geopolitical area, such as a state or
the European Union, with only citizens or residents of that area being
allowed to sell or to receive organs.</li>

<li>
There is a central public body responsible for making (and funding)
all purchases and for allocating organs fairly in accordance with
clinical criteria. Direct sales are banned.</li>

<li>
Prices are set at a reasonably generous level to attract people
voluntarily into the market.</li>
</ol>
<p>

Features (1) and (2) combined are supposed to rule out exploitative
organ trafficking from poorer countries, while the ban on direct sales
and allocation by a central agency ensure that the organs go not to
those most able to pay, but to those in most need. In common with
many other defenders of organ sale, Erin and Harris also propose
building in practical protections for donors and rsales
and allocation by a central agency ensure that the organs go not to
those most able to pay, but to those in most need. In common with
many otherecipients (e.g.,
adequate medical care and thorough health checkups before donation
takes place).</p>

<p>

When ethically evaluating organ sale therefore it is best to focus
not on the worst aspects of today's organ trafficking practices
(since that is not what any serious ethicist is defending or proposing)
but rather on what a reasonably well-regulated system of organ sale,
controlled by some combination of the medical profession and state
regulators, would look like. More specifically, it should be
assumed (as it is in what follows) that the doctors, nurses, and
transplant coordinators implementing an organ sale system should at
least adhere to the standards around consent and clinical care
advocated by The Transplantation Society and the World Health
Organisation (leaving aside of course those bodies' opposition to
organ sale itself) (see <a href="#Oth">Other Internet Resources section</a> below).</p>

<p>

One final preliminary point to keep in mind is the distinction
between questions of law and public policy, on the one hand, and
personal morality on the other. The debate about organ sale is
largely about whether this should be allowed (by law) and, if so, about
what system of remuneration would be best. However, there is a
set of separable questions about personal morality: about (for example)
whether buying an organ for oneself might be morally proabout whether this should be allowed (by law) and, if so, about
what system of remuneration would be best. However, there is a
set of separable questiblematic even
if it should not be prohibited. Although this distinction is
important, and should be kept in mind throughout, it will not be
referred to much in the following sections. That is because, for
the most part, the very same arguments are used both in attempts to
show that organ sale is morally problematic and in attempts to show
that it ought not to be allowed.</p>

<h2><a name="CasForOrgSal">2. The Case for Organ Sale</a></h2>

<p>

Three main positive arguments are advanced in favour of permitting
organ sale.</p>

<h3><a name="ArgBasPriResForAutLibNotSelOwn">2.1 Arguments Based on the Principle of Respect for Autonomy, on Libertarianism, or on a notion of Self-Ownership</a></h3>

<p>

While there are many different variants under this heading, the
basic claim common to all is that autonomous and competent adults have
a strong presumptive right to do as they please with their own bodies
(especially where this is not substantially harmful to third
parties). Therefore, at least in the absence of strong reasons to
do otherwise, people should be allowed to sell parts of their bodies if
they so wish. Whether there are any such strong reasons is of
course a moot point and the main candidate reasons are discussed in
subsequent sections.</p>

<p>

Not much directly will be said about these positive arguments for
permitting organ sale since they rely on mohether there are any such strong reasons is of
course a moot point and the main candidate reasons are discussed in
subsequent sections.</p>

<p>

Not re fundamental and general
questions in moral and political theory that cannot be tackled within
the confines of a piece on organ sale (within SEP, see the
entries on <a href="../libertarianism/">libertarianism</a>,
 <a href="../privacy-medicine/">privacy and medicine</a>, and
 <a href="../property/">property and ownership</a>). Later sections
will indirectly address these arguments, though, because many of the
objections to sale considered could, if successful, overturn any
defeasible presumption in favour of allowing
&lsquo;self-ownership&rsquo; to prevail.</p>

<h3><a name="SavLiv">2.2 The Saving of Lives</a></h3>

<p>

This argument is straightforward. Permitting (or encouraging)
organ sale will, it is claimed, save lives by (at least partially)
alleviating the shortage of transplant organs. The saving of
lives is a good end and organ sale is then defensible as a means of
achieving that positive end.</p>

<p>

That the shortage of transplant organs is a major problem is beyond
dispute. An important UK report published in 2008, for example,
notes that while in 2006&ndash;7 more than 3,000 patients in the UK received
an organ transplant, another 1,000 died whilst waiting or after being
removed from the waiting list because they had become too
ill (Department of Health 2008). The national waiting
list at that time stood at 7,235, a figure that has been incrUK received
an organ transplant, another 1,000 died whilst waiting or after being
removed from the waiting list because they had become too
ill (Depareasing by
8% each year. Furthermore, the waiting list size does not even fully
reflect the actual level of need because doctors are sometimes
reluctant even to list patients who they feel do not stand a realistic
chance of getting an organ in time (Department of Health
2008). Similarly, around one million Americans are said to be on
transplant waiting lists, with a further million people in China
requiring organ transplantation of one kind or another. In the
USA in 2004, the overall median waiting time for a kidney transplant
was almost three years (Knoll 2008).</p>

<p>

Opposition to the Saving of Lives Argument takes one of two
forms. It may be objected to empirically, with the critic arguing
either that permitting organ sale would be ineffective or that an
alternative system would work better: for example, the ways in which we
approach bereaved relatives could be improved, as could the ways in
which the possibility of (unpaid) living donation is publicized, or
there could be a move to a Mandated Choice or Presumed Consent
system (Hinkley 2005). Alternatively, one might concede
the empirical point that allowing organ sale would be an effective
option, but nonetheless argue that there are sufficiently strong
countervailing (moral or practical) reasons to justify leaving the
prohibition on sale in place. These reasons are the subject of
some later sections.lowing organ sale would be an effective
option, but nonetheless argue that there are sufficiently strong
countervailing (moral or practical) reasons t</p>

<p>

The Saving of Lives Argument (unless rejected on empirical grounds)
has an important role in placing the onus of proof on the shoulders of
the prohibitionists (those who wish organ sale to be banned). For
given that this prohibition may, in effect, be causing deaths (or at
least preventing the saving of lives) a strong reason to continue with
it will be required.</p>

<h3><a name="Con">2.3 Consistency</a></h3>

<p>

Many authors have pointed out that there appears to be no
fundamental difference between selling organs and other widely accepted
practices, particularly selling one's own &lsquo;risky
labour&rsquo; (work that involves a risk of harm that is the same as or
greater than that involved in organ donation) (Harris 1985;
Brecher 1990, 1994; Wilkinson &amp; Garrard 1996).
Furthermore, common forms of &lsquo;risky labour&rsquo; (coal mining,
deep-sea diving, fire fighting, military service in a just war, etc.)
are often <em>more</em> dangerous than selling a kidney, but are
regarded as heroic, rather than condemned; it is seen as just and
proper to reward those who do these things. This difference in
attitude cannot be justified in terms of the good consequences that
&lsquo;risky labour&rsquo; produces, since the consequences of an organ
sale (often, saving a life) may be just as good or better.
Therefore, it is inconsistent to allow people toence in
attitude cannot be justified in terms of the good consequences that
&lsquo;risky labour&rsquo; produces, since the consequences of an organ
sa be paid for
&lsquo;risky labour&rsquo; while not allowing them to be paid for their
organs. Savulescu (2003, 138) makes the point as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If we should be allowed to sell our labour, why not sell the means to
that labour? If we should be allowed to risk damaging our body
for pleasure (by smoking or skiing), why not for money which we will
use to realise other goods in life? &hellip; or consider the diver. He
takes on a job as a deep sea diver which pays him an extra $30,000
&hellip; This loading is paid because the job has higher risks to
his life and health. He takes the job because he likes holidays in
expensive exotic locations.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><a name="HarRis">3. Harm and Risk</a></h2>

<p>

The first, and most straightforward, objection to organ sale is that
it is excessively harmful or dangerous for paid organ donors.
Present-day organ trafficking certainly does often involve excessive
and unacceptable levels of harm. But, as mentioned earlier, when
considering the moral permissibility of organ sale, it is advisable to
focus not on the worst case, but rather on the likely level of harm
that would occur within a properly regulated system. Once this is
borne in mind, the harm argument against organ sale appears vulnerable
to a number of objections.</p>

<p>

The first (an empirical point) is simply that the most widely
disy level of harm
that would occur within a properly regulated system. Once this is
borne in mind, the harm argument against organ sale appears vulnerabcussed form of organ sale, kidney sale, is not terribly dangerous if
performed in good conditions. The UK body NHS Blood and
Transplant (NHSBT), for example, informs us that the risk of
postoperative death (to the donor) is about one in 3,000. There
is also a small risk (less than 1%) of minor complications (such as
chest, wound, or urine infections). As regards long-term health
risks, NHSBT claims that there is there is no long-term effect on the
health of the donor or on his/her remaining kidney, and that donors are
at no greater risk of developing kidney failure after donating than
anyone in the general population. So, while there are some not
completely insignificant risks to consider, arguably these are
tolerable compared to both the risks to the prospective recipient of
not receiving the kidney, and the financial benefit to the donor,
provided that the level of reward is set at a suitably high level.</p>

<p>

The second objection says that, if our concern is exposing the organ
vendor to risk, then the last thing we should be doing is banning sale
since, as Cameron and Hoffenberg put it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It is the marginalization of paid organ donation that leads to its
performance in less than ideal circumstances. Paid organ donations need
be no more risky than unpaid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

In other words, the best way of avoiding harm to organ e>
<p>
It is the marginalization of paid organ donation that leads to its
performance in less than ideal circumstances. Paid organ donations need
be nvendors is
not to criminalize and drive sale underground but rather to accept and
regulate it. This style of argument is familiar from other contexts:
notably debates about the legalization of abortion, drugs, and
prostitution.</p>

<p>

The third (related) objection is that no matter how dangerous paid
donation is, it need not (as Cameron and Hoffenberg note above) be any
more dangerous than unpaid donation, since the mere fact of payment
does not add any danger. So if paid donation is wrong because of the
danger to which the donor is subjected, then free donation must also be
wrong on the very same ground. Free donation, though, is not wrong; on
the contrary, it is generally regarded as commendable and heroic.
Therefore, paid donation is not wrong either; or, if it is wrong, it is
wrong because of something other than the danger to which the donor is
subjected.</p>

<p>

It might be argued that what is wrong with organ sale is not danger
<em>per se</em> but rather the fact that someone is being paid to
endanger herself. There are two readings of this. One is as a worry
about consent, the idea being that payment invalidates the
vendor's consent; this will be examined in Section 5. The other
is as a moral principle according to which (independently of concerns
about consent) it is wrong to pay someone to endanger herself. Quite
what the basis for such a prinyment invalidates the
vendor's consent; this will be examined in Section 5. The other
is as a moral principle according to which (independently of conciple might be is hard to fathom and it
does seem implausible for reasons given during the earlier discussion
of consistency. Paying people to undertake dangerous and/or
unpleasant work is widespread and, while the world might well be a
better place if people were not required to undertake such tasks, it
would be hard to defend the view that all such arrangements are wrong:
especially in those cases where the work is done voluntarily for fair
pay.</p>

<h2><a name="Alt">4. Altruism</a></h2>

<p>

A very different style of argument against organ sale appeals to the
supposed value of altruism. These arguments arise in a number of
different forms, but most of them have the following underlying
structure:</p>
<ol>
<li>Altruism is a good thing, either intrinsically, or because of its
positive effects (or both).</li>

<li>
Permitting and/or practicing organ sale would lessen the amount of
altruism in the world.</li>

<li>
 So we
ought not to permit and/or practice organ sale.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="AltAlwGooThi">4.1 Is altruism (always) a good thing?</a></h3>

<p>

Altruism is usually defined as acting out of a concern for the
well-being of others (Nagel 1970; Scott &amp; Seglow
2007). Why might one think that such actions are morally good? Two
main answers are available. The first is that altruism is intrinsically
good and to be contrasted with morally bad charconcern for the
well-being of others (Nagel 1970; Scott &amp; Seglow
2007). Why might one think that such actions are morally good? Two
main answers aacteristics and
motivations, in particular selfishness. The second (which is not
incompatible with the first) says that altruism is good because of its
positive effects, not only its direct effects on the person to whom the
altruism is directed but also its indirect effects on society.
Both answers have considerable plausibility. Many examples of
acting out of disinterested concern for the well-being of others do
seem to be clear-cut cases of moral virtuousness. And it seems
likely that, all other things being equal, a society with more
altruistic acts would be a better place to live than one with
fewer.</p>

<p>

That said, two reservations about the claim that altruism is a good
thing should be noted. First, altruistic acts are not always morally
good. Scott and Seglow (2007, 2) give the following very
pertinent example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Consider the racist organ donor &hellip; who wishes to donate their
organs, but only to those of their own race. They are altruistic
but hardly moral.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Indeed, there seem to be several ways in which an altruistic act might
be wrong. For example:</p>
<ol>
<li> The
altruist is culpably mistaken about what is really in the interests of
the person s/he is trying to help and ends up harming rather than
helping.</li>

<li>
 The
altruist benefits the person s/he is trying to help, but her
intervention isp>
<ol>
<li> The
altruist is culpably mistaken about what is really in the interests of
the person s/he is trying to help and ends up harming rather t wrongfully paternalistic.</li>

<li>
The
altruist benefits the person s/he is trying to help, but in so doing
wrongfully harms innocent third parties.</li>
</ol>
<p>
It is not hard to come up with examples in which <em>A</em> loves <em>B</em> so much that
<em>A</em> is prepared to do bad things to a third party, <em>C</em>, in order to benefit
<em>A</em>. Such cases range from minor wrongdoing to serious evil. So, as
McLachlan (1998) points out, while many acts of altruism are paradigm
cases of virtue, others are &lsquo;extremely wicked&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
In defence of the value of altruism, it could be argued that even
though many altruistic acts are wrong, all things considered,
nonetheless altruism is always a positive (or
&lsquo;right-making&rsquo;) characteristic. On this view, the
analysis of Scott and Seglow's racist donor example is that,
while his racism is to be condemned, his altruism is not and that, in
the case of racist donation (assuming that this really is wrong, all
things considered), the &lsquo;negative&rsquo; racism simply
<em>outweighs</em> the &lsquo;positive&rsquo; altruism. If this
view is correct, then the claim that some altruistic acts are wrong
becomes less relevant than it might at first appear, since what matters
is the value of altruism as a <em>positive moral property</em> of
actions, not whether all altruistic acts are good orw is correct, then the claim that some altruistic acts are wrong
becomes less relevant than it might at first appear, since what matters
is the value  permissible
<em>all things considered</em>.</p>

<h3><a name="WouOrgSalDisRedAlt">4.2 Would organ sale displace or reduce altruism?</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
&hellip; if to a voluntary blood donor system we add the possibility of
selling blood, we have only expanded the individual's range of
alternatives. If he derives satisfaction from giving &hellip; he can
still give, and nothing has been done to impair that right
(Arrow 1972, 350).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

As the quotation from Arrow (above) suggests, there is a puzzle
about why permitting payment for blood or organs should be thought to
reduce the amount of altruism in the world. For why
couldn't paid and unpaid donation systems peacefully coexist,
with people who want to give freely continuing to do so? Furthermore,
paid donations may even add to the amount of altruism in the world. For
there can be cases in which a person sells an organ not for
&lsquo;selfish&rsquo; reasons, but in order to pay (for example) for
someone else's medical care (Brecher 1994).</p>

<p>

Given this, how exactly will allowing organ sale lead to there being
less altruism in the world? The main answer given is that it would
undermine the practice of free donation. Abouna (1991, 167), for
example, claims that there is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
&hellip; considerable evidence to indicate that marketing in human
organs will eventually deprecate and destroy the present willingness of
members of the public to donate their organs out of altruism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

One explanation for this is that when we give people financial
incentives to do some act this undermines or reduce the extent to which
they feel morally obliged to do that act. In this way, financial
incentives &lsquo;crowd out&rsquo; altruism (Satz 2010, 193).</p>

<p>

But is it really true that kidney sale would undermine the practice
of free donation? Well, it <em>could</em> do and ultimately this
is a contested empirical matter about which, as a mere
philosopher, one ought not to claim to have an authoritative
view. That said, it is worth tentatively noted a number of
reasons for being sceptical about the suggestion that kidney sale would
undermine the practice of free donation.</p>
<p>

The most important of these is that, at least as far as living
donation is concerned, there is not a very large practice out there to
be undermined. Given the pain, risk, and inconvenience involved,
free donation (except by relatives to one another) is likely to remain
a minority pursuit. Having said that, living donation is on the
rise and a paper in <em>Kidney International</em> reports that in 2006,
27,000 related and unrelated legal living donor kidney transplants were
performed worldwide, &ldquo;representing 39% of all kidney
transt. Having said that, living donation is on thplants&rdquo;. The same paper reports that &ldquo;the number
of living kidney donor transplants grew over the last decade, with
62% of countries reporting at least a
50% increase&rdquo; (Salimah 2009). However, given
the figures cited earlier about the scale of unmet need and waiting
lists, even these advances seem unlikely to deliver the number of
organs required in the foreseeable future. So, even if some
altruistic donations are lost as a result of sale being permitted,
given the limited scale of altruistic living donation, this may be a
worthwhile trade-off. Furthermore, as was noted above, there is
nothing to stop a living donor being paid and giving the money away
altruistically, thus increasing the extent of her
&lsquo;gifting&rsquo;.</p>

<p>

Kidneys may then be importantly different from (say) blood. For if
there is no substantial system of free donation in place, then free
donation cannot be undermined by permitting sale. But if an almost
adequate system of free donation does exist (as, in many countries, it
does with blood) then there is a serious possibility of its being
undermined. Thus, the argument which says that what is wrong with sale
is that free donation would be undermined might well work for blood,
even if it does not for kidneys. The same might be true of the
arguments in favour of an altruistic blood system proposed by Titmuss
and otgument which says that what is wrong with sale
is that free donation would be undermined might well work for blood,
even if it does not for kidneys. Thers. Perhaps the voluntary blood donation system (and
indeed a voluntary posthumous organ donation system) can be used as a
method of encouraging a valuable culture of altruism, but this is much
less likely to work in the case of living organ donation
(Archard 2002; Campbell 2009; Titmuss 1997).</p>
<p>

This difference between kidneys and blood reveals a general
structural difficulty for altruism arguments against sale. For altruism
arguments (insofar as they work at all) work better for those things
which are already freely donated on a large scale, than for those
things which are hardly freely donated at all. Hence, they will tend to
be most successful where, in a sense, they are needed least&mdash;because if there is already widespread free donation, then
commercialization will be unnecessary. This is not a decisive
objection, since there are things which are in short supply in spite of
widespread free donation (blood and sperm might be examples of this).
But it is a problem for this style of argument because there will be a
tendency for it to be least successful where it is most needed
(Radcliffe Richards 1996, 2009; Wilkinson &amp; Moore
1999).</p>

<h3><a name="AltSupDutRes">4.3 Altruism, Supererogation, and Duties to Rescue</a></h3>

<p>

However, even if altruism can survive this first challenge, there is a second reason to question its importance rds 1996, 2009; Wilkinson &amp; Moore
1999).</p>

<h3><a name="AltSupDutRes">4.3 Altruism, Supererogation, and Duties to Rescue</a></h3>

<p>

Howeverfor the debate about the permissibility of organ
sale. This is the distinction between cases in which altruism is <em>obligatory</em> (where there is a moral duty to help others) and those in which altruism is
<em>supererogatory</em> (morally good, but not morally required&mdash;going &lsquo;above and beyond&rsquo; one's
duty) (Wilkinson 2003). This distinction is relevant for the
following reason. If (say) altruistic kidney donation were morally
obligatory, then to demand money for one's organ (and, arguably,
to accede to such a demand) would be wrong. But if, on the other hand,
altruistic donation were supererogatory, then to demand money for
one's organ would not be wrong. Rather, it would be merely
non-supererogatory: perhaps not <em>good</em>, but not <em>wrong</em>.
So, with this distinction in place, one might (at least in some cases)
accept that altruistic donations are good whilst also saying that there
is nothing wrong with non-altruistic donation&mdash;the point being
that non-altruistic donation, while not as good as altruistic donation,
is nonetheless (morally) permissible. This has implications for the
sort of altruism argument which can be made against organ sale. If it
could be shown that altruistic donation is obligatory then the argument
would be stronger, or at least more straightforward, because it would
follow that selling was wrong (it  for the
sort of altruism argument which can be made against organ sale. If it
could be shown that altruistic donation is obligatory then the argumentis wrong to demand money for what one
ought to be giving freely anyway). But if all that could be shown was
that altruistic donation is good, then it would not follow from this,
or at least it would not follow directly, that selling is wrong. For it
might be merely non-supererogatory (Wilkinson &amp; Garrard
1996).</p>

<p>

This may be one area then where the differences between different
possible organ sale systems are relevant. For it is not wildly
implausible to posit the existence of a duty to donate one's
organs for posthumous transplantation. Indeed, this view is not
confined to utilitarian bioethicists, with even the Church of England
stating in 2007 that (posthumous) organ donation is a Christian
duty (BBC News Online 2007). Thus there may well be a valid
altruism argument against a system in which people sell rights to their
body after death: the argument being that they should donate them
anyway without expecting payment. This style of argument looks
less promising, though, when looking at non-directed living kidney
donation (to strangers). Here, I suspect most of us want to say
that becoming such a donor is heroic and supererogatory, not a moral
obligation, and so the altruism argument does not engage. Another
interesting example is blood (from living donors). In many
countries, there is a widespread view that people ought to do this
freely and ( a donor is heroic and supererogatory, not a moral
obligation, and so the altruism argument does not engage. Another
interesting example is blood (froif this view is correct) this could underpin an altruism
argument against paying for blood: the claim being that people ought
not to be paid for that which they have an obligation freely to
give.</p>

<h2><a name="IndCon">5. Inducements and Consent</a></h2>
<p>

Monetary incentives, it is sometimes argued, make valid consent
difficult, impossible, or problematic (Radcliffe Richards
2010). Some of the main arguments offered for this view are that&mdash;</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Financial incentives encourage people to do things that they would
not otherwise do.</li>

<li>Financial incentives encourage people to do things that are likely
to be harmful to them and which go against their &lsquo;better
judgement&rsquo;.</li>

<li>Financial incentives can make people's actions, consents, and
decisions less autonomous or less voluntary (Wilkinson 2005).</li>
</ol>
<p>

(a) will not work. For the fact that payments encourage people
to do things that they otherwise would not does not, in and of itself,
invalidate consent. If it did, consent problems would be endemic
and occur every time someone was encouraged by payment to go to work
for wages or to surrender property for a price. So although some people
would only provide organs because of the money, this fact alone would
not invalidate consent.</p>

<p>

(b) is more plausible. Or at least one was encouraged by payment to go to work
for wages or to surrender property for a price. So although some people
would only provide organs because it is plausible to suppose
that we ought not to encourage donors to subject themselves to more
than a certain level of danger. But the fundamental problem with
this would be not payment or consent, but rather the fact that they are
exposed to too much danger. So, provided that we have an adequate
way of controlling and regulating risk to organ sellers this particular
worry about payment ought not to arise.</p>

<p>

This is supported by the following two additional
considerations.</p>

<p>

First, as mentioned earlier, the amount of danger remains the same
regardless of whether or not payment takes place. So if someone
objects to paying donors on the grounds that payment will encourage
excessive risk-taking, s/he ought to object to donation itself
(including free donation) not just the payment. Imagine someone
who objects to paying astronauts on the grounds that it encourages them
to do something excessively dangerous. Surely we should say to
her that, if the objection is danger, s/he should object to space
travel <em>in general,</em> not (just) to <em>paid</em> space
travel. Much the same goes for paying organ donors. If the
worry is danger, we should object to dangerous donation of all kinds,
not just the paid variety.</p>

<p>

Second, it is not clear that monetary incentives make people act
against their better interests or judgement. Indeed, this is a
rgan donors. If the
worry is danger, we should object to dangerous donation of all kinds,
not just the paid variety.</p>

<p>

Second, it is not clear ather surprising view to take since people trade off monetary gains
and losses against other factors on a daily basis; commerce and work
require us to do this all the time. So if an adequately informed
and competent person decides, after deliberation, that it is worth
subjecting herself to a given risk in return for $5,000 then we should
not just assume that s/he is acting against her better judgement since,
for all we know, the $5,000 is more valuable to her than avoiding the
risk (Wilkinson 2005).</p>

<p>

Finally, there is (c): the idea that financial incentives make
people's decisions (or consents) less voluntary. The
thought here is that certain sorts of payment, or payment in certain
circumstances, exert undue influence on a person's
decision (Nuffield Council on Bioethics 2002). Accusations
of undue inducement almost always occur in one of two different
contexts. The first is where the &lsquo;victim&rsquo; of the inducement
is in desperate need of money; the second is where the
&lsquo;victim&rsquo; is not desperate, but is offered such a huge
amount of money to do <em>X</em> that doing <em>X</em> becomes almost irresistible.
Wilkinson terms these &lsquo;desperate offeree&rsquo; cases and
&lsquo;enormous offer&rsquo; cases. One notable thing that these have
in common is that there is a huge gap between the offeree's
welfare-level if s/he does not acceomes almost irresistible.
Wilkinson terms these &lsquo;desperate offeree&rsquo; cases and
&lsquo;enormous offer&rsquo; cases. One notable thing that tpt the offer, and her welfare-level
if s/he does accept (Wilkinson 2003).</p>
<p>

Is valid consent possible in these cases? In both scenarios it
may be terrifically hard to decline. However this does not mean
that valid consent to the offer is impossible. Radcliffe Richards
(2010, 291) makes the point as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It does not normally occur to us that people coerced by circumstances
into doing things they would not otherwise do should have their consent
regarded as invalid. If you have cancer, with the choice between
risking its unchecked progression and putting up with pretty nasty
treatments, nobody would think of arguing that the narrow range of
options made your consent to treatment invalid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>

So even if we grant that the recipients of enormous offers and
desperate offerees will find it hard to refuse, this does not mean that
they cannot validly consent. This must be so. Otherwise, it would be
impossible for anyone ever to consent validly to lifesaving operations,
not to mention lottery &lsquo;jackpot&rsquo; wins or large wage rises;
the mere fact that a proposal is tremendously attractive does not mean
that it cannot be voluntarily accepted.</p>
<p>

A slightly different tack is to invoke the idea of coercion by
circumstances, specifically coercion by poverty (Annas 1984;
Torcello &amp; Wear 2000). Thus, someone is tremendously attractive does not mean
that it cannot be voluntarily accepted.</p>
<p>

A slightly different tack is to invoke the idea of coercion might argue that
even though valid consent from &lsquo;desperate&rsquo; people is
possible in principle for the reasons just given, consent will normally
be invalid when the person consenting (e.g., to selling her kidney) is
coerced by poverty. The difference between coercion by poverty
and Radcliffe Richards' cancer example is supposed to be that
whereas the cancer is a morally neutral natural occurrence, the poverty
(at least in some cases) is the result of immoral acts and policies; it
is unjust poverty.</p>
<p>

One initial response to the &lsquo;coercion by poverty&rsquo; refers
us back to the fact that almost all defenders of organ sale are arguing
not for unfettered international trafficking in transplant organs but
rather for a regulated system of compensation. Within the context
of a regulated system (particularly that advocated by Erin and Harris,
which would be limited to one economic area) there is no reason to
believe that most organ sellers would be desperately poor. Organ
sale may admittedly be more attractive to those with the least money
(for why would someone rich need or want to sell an organ?) but then
much the same can be said of some of the least sought-after and worst
paid agricultural and cleaning jobs, and we do not generally say that
people cannot consent to do these or that these types of employment
should be banned.</p>

<p>

Butrgan?) but then
much the same can be said of some of the least sought-after and worst
paid agricultural and cleaning jobs, and we do not generally say let us allow for the sake of argument that organ vendors would
be very poor. What would follow from this? Poverty (or
threatening poverty) can clearly be a method of coercion. An
obvious example of this is the behaviour of exploitative employers
during times of high unemployment. They can threaten workers with
unemployment&mdash;and, hence, poverty&mdash;if they do not comply
with their demands (Wilkinson 2003). The position of the
prospective organ buyer though seems rather unlike that of the
exploitative employer and, as Wilkinson and Moore (1999, 378) point
out:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>

&hellip; it is a necessary condition of an offer's being
coercive that the offerer is also responsible for the bad circumstances
of the offeree. For example, if we poison you and then offer to provide
the only available antidote in exchange for your stamp collection, that
is coercive. If you are poisoned in a way for which we are not
responsible, and we make the same offer, that is not coercive &hellip;
as long as those making an offer are not responsible for the
circumstances of the potential subjects, their offer is not
coercive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

So in order for prospective organ purchasers to be coercing through
poverty, they must be responsible for the poverty. This need not
mean that they caused the poverty, for people may be responsible for
(improving or prevenoercive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

So in order for prospective organ purchasers to be coercing through
poverty, they must be responsible for the povertyting) situations that they have not themselves
caused. Hence, another scenario in which the buyers may be
responsible is if they have a positive duty to rescue the prospective
sellers from poverty (and &lsquo;for free&rsquo; rather than in
exchange for an organ).</p>

<p>

An illuminating analogy is Nozick's Drowning Case
(Nozick 1969, 449). This is a situation in which <em>P</em> (the occupant
of a boat) offers to save <em>Q</em> (who is drowning close to the boat) but
only if <em>Q</em> promises to pay <em>P</em> $10,000 within three days of reaching
shore. One view of this case is that <em>P</em> coerces <em>Q</em> (into paying) if and
only if <em>P</em> has a freestanding duty to save <em>Q</em> without reward.
Whether <em>P</em> does in fact have such a duty is not something we need to
decide upon here and that will depend upon a wide range of facts about
the situation.</p>

<p>

Organ vendors then are somewhat like the person in the boat.
If they have an independent duty to alleviate the poverty (i.e., a duty
that does not depend on their getting an organ in return) then to
insist on an organ for the money (when they should have been giving the
money anyway) would be coercive. It would be like charging
someone who would otherwise drown in a situation where there is a duty
freely to rescue.</p>

<p>

It is not hard to see how, in principle, this style ooney (when they should have been giving the
money anyway) would be coercive. It would be like charging
someone who would otherwise drown in a situatiof coercion
argument could work against organ sale. What is much harder is working
out whether, in most of the cases envisaged, organ buyers have a duty
to alleviate the poverty. The case most often discussed is where
the organ purchaser is a rich Westerner and the vendor is someone
desperately poor from the developing world. The Westerner, it is
said, uses poverty to &lsquo;force&rsquo; (coerce) the poor person into
giving up the organ. This <em>may</em> be the case if the
Westerner has a duty to alleviate the prospective organ seller's
poverty. But, as well as difficult general questions about global
distributive justice and the like, there is also the question of
whether the individual in question is directly responsible for alleviating the
other's poverty in these cases. The problem with
attributing responsibility to individual organ purchasers is that the
extent to which they have a positive &lsquo;duty to rescue&rsquo; those
in dire poverty may vary enormously depending on their own positions of
wealth and power, and on the extent to which they have already done
virtuous things in an attempt to act on their duties towards the poor.
For example, a Western organ purchaser could have already devoted a
large part of her income and time to charitable projects aimed at the
alleviation of poverty and may herself have relatively little money&mdash;just enough their duties towards the poor.
For example, a Western organ purchaser could have already devoted a
large part of her income and time to charitable projo buy a kidney. Do we really want to say that such
a person has a duty to give her money to the prospective organ vendor
without receiving the kidney (without which she may well die) in
return?</p>

<p>

A more promising option is to focus on groups rather than
individuals. One might argue, for example, that the rich nations have a
duty to alleviate poverty in the poor nations. With this (plausible)
assumption in place, it could then be argued that when the rich nations
collectively offer the poor nations money (but only) in return for
organs, this is not really an offer, but rather a threat (a threat to
wrongfully withhold resources if they do not hand over organs).
The rich nations (it is argued) should be giving the money anyway, not
demanding organs in return for it. So what the rich nations are doing
is threatening to withhold resources to which the poor nations have a
moral right, unless the poor nations hand over organs: a seemingly
clear case of coercion.</p>

<p>

However, there is a further problem with the &lsquo;coercion by
poverty&rsquo; argument&mdash;or at least there is a serious problem
with attempting to use it specifically as an argument for the legal
prohibition of organ sale. The problem is that the argument works
equally well against all trade between the rich nations and the poor
ones. For (in simplistic terms) if the rich nations have attempting to use it specifically as an argument for the legal
prohibition of organ sale. The problem is that the argument works
equally well against a duty to give
resources to the poor nations, then any time that the rich nations
insist on trading rather than donating, they will be practicing
coercion&mdash;threatening to withhold money that they should be
giving anyway, unless they are provided with goods of one sort or
another. And, as far as the coercion argument is concerned, there is no
reason to single out the trade in organs for special treatment. This
looks like a decisive objection to the coercion argument. Either it
does not work at all, or it works but &lsquo;proves too much&rsquo; and
gives us no reason to single out organ sale for condemnation and/or
prohibition.</p>

<p>

One possible reply to this is to make a distinction between forms of
global trade which benefit developing world economies and societies and
those which do not. One might then argue that a difference
between the organ trade and (say) the development of hi-tech
manufacturing is that only the latter has the potential to economically
emancipate populations in the longer-term, whereas buying an organ is
merely a &lsquo;resource grab&rsquo; with no positive side-effects on
socio-economic development. Like many of the other arguments
discussed in this entry, much depends on the how the empirical evidence
shapes up, but this response does seem to have some plausibility.
However, it could still be claimed that the international cio-economic development. Like many of the other arguments
discussed in this entry, much depends on the how the empirical evidence
shapes up, but thisorgan trade
is no worse (as far as the quality of consent is concerned) than any
other form of international trade which fails to positively contribute
to long-term development. So perhaps the organ trade is (in this
respect) on a par with logging, or mining, or some basic forms of
agriculture.</p>

<p>

Perhaps more importantly, though, we must remember that, in any
case, most of these concerns about coercion and poverty can be dealt
with by having a controlled system such as the Erin-Harris
proposal. Of course it is not the case that there is no unfair
poverty within the Western countries that they have in mind. And
so, even under the Erin-Harris system, some account would have to be
taken of the coercion by poverty argument. Perhaps, for example,
we would want to say that, in order for the national organ purchasing
agency not to be coercing-by-poverty it needs to be the case that there
is a minimum wage law and a welfare state that are at least close to
being fair, so that there is no poverty in society for which the state
is morally responsible (either actively or by omission). This is
probably a lot to ask but then we must remember that any actual organ
sale system, along with all other aspects of the economy, is unlikely
to be perfect; and, provided that the organ sale system is not
substantially more exploitative or harmful than most other widely
acceask but then we must remember that any actual organ
sale system, along with all other aspects of the economy, is unlikely
to be perfect; and, providedpted economic transactions then it would seem arbitrary and unfair
to single it out for particular condemnation or prohibition.</p>

<p>

Finally, Radcliffe Richards offers an argument to the effect that
even if there is a consent problem caused by &lsquo;coercion through
poverty&rsquo; (a claim about which she is sceptical) this is unlikely
to be a sound basis for <em>prohibiting</em> sale. She asks us to
consider a case in which your daughter is kidnapped. The
kidnappers ask for a ransom in return for your daughter's
life. Clearly, your consent to this arrangement (if forthcoming)
would be invalid because coerced. But&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>

<p>
Suppose the police appeared on the kidnapping scene and prevented you
from signing the [ransom payment] document, perhaps with the outcome
that your child was shot. They might have good public policy
reasons for doing this &hellip; but it would be preposterous for them
to claim that they were doing it because the consent you were trying to
give would be invalid &hellip; [T]he whole point of declaring
invalidity is to protect the alleged consenter, and here the police
would actually be compounding the wrong done to you by constricting
still further the range of options already constricted by the
kidnapper (Radcliffe Richards 2010, 294).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

According to Radcliffe Richards, this is analogous to tice
would actually be compounding the wrong done to you by constricting
still further the range of options already constricted by the
kidnapper (Radclhe situation
in which state action is used to prevent organ sale. As with the
kidnapping, there may be legitimate reasons for such state action (for
example, if the police suspect that the organ purchaser's surgeon
is planning to take several organs and then kill the organ
vendor). However, the invalidity of the seller's consent
(due to poverty) would not in and of itself be a sufficient reason for
state intervention in these circumstances.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>
Since the metaphorical coercer (poverty) is still present, and the
individual is making the best choice among a still-constricted range of
options, disallowing the choice is like preventing you from meeting the
demands of the kidnapper while he still has your child
(Radcliffe Richards 2010, 294).</p>

So <em>even if</em> there is a quality of consent problem in these
organ sale cases this is unlikely to justify prohibition.</p>

<h2><a name="ExpInsObj">6. Exploitation, Instrumentalisation, and Objectification</a></h2>

<p>

Organ sale is commonly accused of being exploitative. Saying
what exploitation amounts to is itself a complex task, however, and I
will not say much here about how it should be defined (see
the SEP entry on <a href="../exploitation/">exploitation</a>). 
It is, however, worth noting
that, on one view, defective (or invalid) consent is a necessary
condition for th task, however, and I
will not say much here about how it should be defined (see
the SEP entry on <a href="../exploitation/">exploitation</a>). 
It ise occurrence of exploitation. Thus (according to
this view) a transaction can only be exploitative if the putative
victim of exploitation is coerced, lacking capacity, ill-informed, or
manipulated (or more generally, if there is some consent-invalidating
factor in play). If this view of the relationship between consent
and exploitation were correct, then the discussion of exploitation
could be ended here; for consent issues were dealt with in the previous
section and the exploitation worry about organ sale would only be worth
taking seriously inasmuch as those consent arguments discussed above
were sound. However, not everyone thinks that defective consent
is required for there to be exploitation and so there may be some
mileage in looking independently at exploitation.</p>

<p>

Similar thoughts apply to the unjust distribution of benefits and
burdens. One view is that a transaction can only count as
exploitative if the relevant benefits and burdens are unfairly
distributed in favour of the exploiter and/or against the
exploited. With this in mind, Harris (Harris 1985, 120) usefully
distinguishes between two kinds of exploitation-claim. The
first:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>
&hellip; involves the idea of some disparity in the value of an
exchange of goods and services.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Exploitation concerns of this kind, or at least most of them, can be
tako kinds of exploitation-claim. The
first:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>
&hellip; involves the idea of some disparity in the value of an
exchange of goods and en care of by utilizing some version of the Erin-Harris proposal
(discussed above) since this is designed to ensure that organ
sellers receive just rewards and adequate care, whilst also going a
long way towards ensuring that the distribution of organs to transplant
recipients is fair. And while there may be some practical
obstacles to creating such a system there seem no reasons to suppose
that it is impossible in principle.</p>

<p>
There is, however, another sense of &lsquo;exploitation&rsquo;.
This is:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>
&hellip; the idea of <em>wrongful</em> use and may occur when there are
no financial or commercial dimensions to the transaction. A classic
case here would be where it is claimed that lovers may exploit one
another, that is, use one another in some wrongful way. The most
familiar of such wrongful ways in this context might be where it is
claimed that one partner uses the other or treats the other merely as a
&lsquo;sex object&rsquo; (Harris 1985, 120).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

Similarly Goodin (1987, 166) notes that:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>

Lovers can exploit one another just as surely as can economic
classes. Yet neither party in an affectionate relationship is
functioning in any standard sense as a &lsquo;factor of
production&rsquo;. Nor, since neither party is creating valuable
objects in any ordinary respect, does it in that contextas can economic
classes. Yet neither party in an affectionate relationship is
functioning in any standard sense as a &lsquo;factor of
production&rsquo make much
sense to define exploitation in the standard economics-based terms
&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

So it looks as if (in Harris's terms) &lsquo;wrongful
use&rsquo; exploitation is independent of some of the usual concerns
about distributive justice and could persist even within a
distributively fair organ sale system. Exploitation of this
second kind is closely related to, or even the same as, a number of
other concepts or terms (Wilkinson 2003). One of these is
<em>objectification</em>: wrongfully treating something (or someone)
that is not a mere object as if it were a mere object. Another is
<em>instrumentalisation</em>, which can be similarly defined as
treating something (or someone) that is not a mere means as if it were
a mere means. These ideas are closely connected to the Kantian
idea of dignity. As Dillon (2010) puts it, on this view:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>
To be a person is to have a status and worth that is unlike that of any
other kind of being: it is to be an end in itself with dignity. And the
only response that is appropriate to such a being is respect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

Instrumentalisation in particular (failing to treat someone as an
&lsquo;end&rsquo;) is a failure to respect a person's
dignity.</p>

<p>

So we have the claim that a certain kind of exploitation,
objectification, or instrumentalisation, could occur within
dirumentalisation in particular (failing to treat someone as an
&lsquo;end&rsquo;) is a failure to respect a person's
dignity.</p>

<p>

So we have the stributively fair transactions. How might this apply in the
case of organ sale? Specifically, how could these ideas underpin
a sound moral argument against organ sale?</p>

<p>

In common with some of the arguments considered earlier, attempts to
use these ideas in an argument against organ sale run up against two
problems. First, there is the similarity of (free) donation and
sale. Let us say that someone objects to organ sale (even where
there is consent and distributive justice) on the grounds that the
seller's body (organ) or the seller herself is objectified or
instrumentalised. This immediately raises the question of why the
very same consideration does not apply to (free) donation, which is
standardly thought to be admirable rather than morally dubious.
For in both cases, a part of the donor's (or vendor's) body
is removed and treated (quite possibly solely) as a means by the
recipient and the transplant team.</p>

<p>

Then, second, there is the question of consent. For can we
really make sense of someone being instrumentalised or objectified (in
the relevant normative or pejorative senses of these terms) if what is
done to them is done with valid consent, and especially if what is done
to them would not have been done but for their giving of valid
consent? So one possible principle that we might wish to endorse
here is that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Iferms) if what is
done to them is done with valid consent, and especially if what is done
to them would not have been done but for their giving of vali <em>A</em> requires and obtains from <em>B</em> valid consent to do <em>x</em> to <em>B</em>, that is
sufficient to guarantee that, in doing <em>x</em> to <em>B</em>, <em>A</em> does not wrongfully
instrumentalise or objectify <em>B</em>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Or, to put it another way, as with the other sort of
exploitation discussed above, perhaps even instrumentalisation and
objectification turn out to rely on defective consent: or perhaps
rather on the fact that the putative instrumentaliser (objectifier)
does not care about or require valid consent. Alternatively we
might make this principle slightly more cautious and include a
substantial harm constraint as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
If <em>A</em> requires and obtains from <em>B</em> valid consent to do <em>x</em> to <em>B</em>,
<em>and</em> if doing <em>x</em> to <em>B</em> will not substantially harm <em>B</em>, that is
sufficient to guarantee that, in doing <em>x</em> to <em>B</em>, <em>A</em> does not wrongfully
instrumentalise or objectify <em>B</em>.</p></blockquote>

<p>To help think through these principles consider the case of
Manuel Wackenheim. Wackenheim is a (so-called) &lsquo;dwarf&rsquo; who
(until a ban was imposed by the local mayor) made a living from being
&lsquo;tossed&rsquo; by customers in bars and nightclubs. This
&lsquo;tossing&rsquo; formed part of a dwarf throwing competitinheim. Wackenheim is a (so-called) &lsquo;dwarf&rsquo; who
(until a ban was imposed by the local mayor) made a living from being
&lsquo;tossed&rsquo; on&mdash;a sport &lsquo;in which the aim of the competitors is to fling
a dwarf over the furthest distance possible&rsquo; (Millns 1996,
375). Wackenheim appeared keen to pursue his chosen career and
didn't welcome the ban on dwarf throwing, saying &lsquo;this
spectacle is my life; I want to be allowed to do what I
want&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Wackenheim can be regarded both as intrinsically valuable
as a person but also as instrumentally valuable as an object
(specifically as a projectile). That is, there is no reason in
principle why a friend of his could not both respect him as an
&lsquo;end&rsquo; and recognise the fact that his body is formed in a
way which makes it instrumentally valuable to &lsquo;dwarf
throwers&rsquo;. But could Wackenheim's friend <em>actually use
him</em> as a projectile, whilst at the same time respecting the fact
that he is a person or (in Kantian terms) an end-in-himself? It
is the overall context of the relationship, along with other structural
features of the situation, which determine whether he is appropriately
respected. Surely this must be right, for it would be extraordinarily
hard to argue plausibly that it is impossible, in all contexts, to use
Wackenheim as a projectile whilst at the same time respecting his
personhood. For what if he enjoys being thrown, gets paid for it, and
freely and knowingly consents to it? If for these rd to argue plausibly that it is impossible, in all contexts, to use
Wackenheim as a projectile whilst at the same time respecting his
personhood. Forreasons&mdash;i.e.,
because I want to ensure that he derives pleasure and money, and am
certain that it is what he really wants etc.&mdash;I throw him, then
there seems no basis whatsoever for saying that I am failing to respect
his personhood. For in such a case, I am (let us assume) deliberately
giving him what he wants (and wants in a free, informed and otherwise
autonomous way) and deliberately benefiting him. How can this be a
failure to recognise his status as an &lsquo;end&rsquo;?</p>

<p>

It is difficult to see how it could be. Although we should add two
caveats. First, this doesn't rule out the existence of other
separate moral objections to &lsquo;dwarf throwing&rsquo;. Second,
there certainly are contexts in which this practice would constitute
wrongful instrumentalisation. These may include cases in which the
people thrown are substantially harmed and cases in which they do not
consent or in which their consent is invalid. Indeed, this is the main
point. What does all the ethical work here is context: in particular
issues relating to the existence and quality of the
&lsquo;dwarf's&rsquo; consent&mdash;and perhaps also those
relating to harm and welfare.</p>

<p>

Much the same goes for organ sale, or indeed (unpaid) organ
donation. When we look at a person with a view to using her
organs for transplantation we are of course viewing at least the &mdash;and perhaps also those
relating to harm and welfare.</p>

<p>

Much the same goes for organ sale, or indeed (unpaid) organ
donation. When we loorgan,
or possibly even the person, as a means to an end, and as a useful
object. But this is not inconsistent with also respecting the
person's dignity and viewing her as an end-in-herself provided
that we take seriously the person's rational agency by requiring
her valid consent for the organ removal and by ensuring that any risk
of harm is minimized and reasonable. The particular issues for
organ sale (as opposed to free donation) then turn out to be those
discussed at length in previous sections. Perhaps there is an
increased risk that consent will be flawed in sale cases; if organ
removal proceeded without proper consent then that could be a failure
to respect the person. And perhaps there is an increased risk
that harm will occur in sale cases; if so (and if the risk goes above a
certain level) then perhaps this also would constitute a failure to
respect the person. Thus the appeal to dignity,
instrumentalisation, and objectification would seem merely to amplify
some of the more routine concerns aired previously about consent and
harm.</p>
