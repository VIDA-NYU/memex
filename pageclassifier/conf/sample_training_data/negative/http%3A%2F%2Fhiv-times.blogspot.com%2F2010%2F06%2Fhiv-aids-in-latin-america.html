<p><div class="box bFull"><b>At the end of 2008 there were around 2 million people living with HIV in Latin  America - more than in the U.S., Canada, Japan and the UK combined.<sup>1</sup>  While this region has often been overlooked in the past, there is now  growing recognition amongst the international community that the HIV  epidemics of Latin American countries demand more attention than they  have received so far. </b><br />
Latin American countries have been affected by HIV and AIDS in  different ways, and to different extents. Responses have varied, with  some countries displaying weak political leadership and others &#8211; most  notably Brazil &#8211; forming strong and positive responses. Despite many  differences between the epidemics of individual countries, high levels  of poverty, migration, homophobia  and HIV-related discrimination are apparent throughout the region, and  these factors present common barriers to overcoming the crisis.<sup>2</sup><br />
In this page, we use the term Latin America to refer to the countries  of South and Central America, excluding Suriname, Guyana, French Guyana  and the Caribbean islands, which we discuss in our HIV &amp; AIDS in the  Caribbean page. AVERT.org also has an individual country page about AIDS in Brazil.<br />
<a name='more'></a></div><div class="box bFull"><h2>The scale of Latin America&#8217;s AIDS epidemics</h2><div class="photo_r"><img alt="Condom obelisk in

<div style="width: 250px;">Condom obelisk in Buenos Aires</div></div>Although HIV prevalence (the percentage of a population living with  HIV) in Latin American countries is relatively low compared to the rates  found in many parts of Africa, the number of people affected is still  substantial. What is more, the situation is likely to get worse in many  Latin American countries. No country in the region has experienced a  significant drop in HIV prevalence, and it is projected that the total  number of people living with HIV in Latin America will increase in  coming years.<sup>3</sup> As well as affecting millions of people&#8217;s  lives, HIV and AIDS have had widespread social and economic implications  for Latin American countries, and these effects will become more severe  as epidemics worsen.<sup>4</sup><br />
More than half of Latin Americans living with HIV reside in the  region&#8217;s four largest countries: Brazil, Columbia, Mexico and Argentina.  Brazil is home to 730,000 people living with HIV &#8211; more than any other  Latin American country &#8211; but due to the large size of its population,  this equates to a relatively low HIV prevalence of 0.6%. The most severe  epidemics are found in smaller countries such as Belize, Guyana and  Suriname, which have HIV prevalence rates of 2.1%, 2.5% and 2.4%  respectively. The majority of countries in the region have prevalence  rates of less than 1%, but the prevalence among specific groups, such as  men who have sex with men and sex workers, is often very high. For more  figures, see our Latin America Statistics Page.<br />
<h2>Key affected groups</h2><h3>Men who have sex with men</h3>Men who have sex with  men (MSM) account for the largest share of infections in Latin  America.<sup>5</sup> This problem is largely hidden, since homophobia  and &#8216;machismo&#8217; culture are common throughout the region and sex between  men is highly stigmatised. The extent of HIV infection among MSM is  downplayed in many countries, and prevention campaigns often neglect  this group.<br />
An example is Guatemala, where critics have disputed the government&#8217;s  claim that the country&#8217;s AIDS epidemic is primarily heterosexual.  Activists within the country argue that the official statistics, which  attribute around 15% of HIV infections to MSM, do not reflect the  reality of Guatemala&#8217;s epidemic. Some claim that the real figure is  closer to 40%.<sup>6</sup> As one civil society worker explained, MSM  are often hesitant to reveal how they became infected and many are  mistakenly classed as heterosexual:<br />
<blockquote class="bigquoteleft"><div class="bigquotebody">&#8220;Annual spending estimates&#8230; confirm that many  Latin American countries make little effort to provide AIDS-related  services that address the needs of men who have sex with men.&#8221;</div></blockquote><blockquote class="longquote">&#8220;Unless he&#8217;s a total queen, a man will  always be [counted as] heterosexual. Plus, people don&#8217;t want to be  recognised [as homosexual]&#8221;.<cite>Ruben Mayorga, civil society worker,  Guatemala  City<sup>7</sup></cite></blockquote>On the other hand, other Latin American countries &#8211; such as Mexico  and Peru - openly acknowledge that their epidemics are primarily driven  by MSM. In Mexico, the government has appointed Jorge Saavedra, an  openly gay, HIV positive man, as head of its leading AIDS agency, which  has helped the country to make significant progress in addressing the  problem. Among other initiatives, Saavedra has helped to launch a  provocative anti-homophobia campaign.<sup>8</sup> In Peru, a large  amount of research is being conducted relating to HIV and MSM. The  country is now recognised by researchers around the world as an  important base for studies of HIV infection among this group.<br />
<blockquote class="longquote">&#8220;It&#8217;s a very concentrated epidemic, and we  have a very good relationship with the community.&#8221;<cite>Jorge Sanchez,  Peruvian epidemiologist <sup>9</sup></cite></blockquote>Overall 0.5% of Peruvian adults are living with HIV, but studies have  suggested much higher rates of infection among MSM. Research has shown  that men who have sex with men account for 55 percent of HIV incidence  in Peru.<sup>10</sup><br />
For the most part, the epidemic among MSM in Peru has not spread to  other segments of the population, but there is a risk that this will  soon occur. As is the case in other Latin American countries, large  numbers of MSM in Peru do not identify themselves as homosexuals, and  have sex with women as well as men. MSM therefore form a &#8216;bridge&#8217;  population - rising rates of infection among this group are likely to  aggravate the spread of HIV among the heterosexual population.<sup>11</sup>  In both Columbia and Ecuador, it has been reported that a large number  of women with HIV have been infected by their husbands or regular  partners who have acquired infection through sex with another man.<sup>12</sup><br />
While Brazil, Mexico and Peru have made progress in addressing high  infection rates among MSM, most other countries are still neglecting  this group. According to the 2006 UNAIDS global report:<br />
<blockquote class="longquote">&#8220;Annual spending estimates&#8230; confirm that  many Latin American countries make little effort to provide AIDS-related  services that address the needs of men who have sex with men&#8230; Often,  health professionals are too embarrassed to ask the right questions and,  even if asked, men are afraid to provide the right answers.&#8221;<sup>13</sup></blockquote><h3>Sex workers</h3>HIV transmission between sex workers and  their clients is recognised as a major factor in the spread of HIV in  several Latin American countries. The extent to which sex workers are  affected varies between areas &#8211; one study of different countries, which  looked at brothel-based sex workers, found HIV prevalence rates ranging  from 0% to 6.3%.<sup>14</sup> However, higher rates are found among  street-based sex workers, who are harder to reach with HIV prevention  services. In Guatemala, for instance, surveillance suggests that 15% of  street-based sex workers are living with HIV.<sup>15</sup> Similarly,  studies of cities in El Salvador found infection rates of around 16%.<sup>16</sup>  Since condom  use is often low among regular sexual partners, male clients of sex  workers may pass on HIV to their wives and girlfriends once infected.<br />
In some countries, such as Ecuador and Bolivia, relatively low rates  of infection have been found among sex workers. In La Paz, one of  Bolivia&#8217;s capital cities, prevalence was 0.4% in 2007 &#8211; a figure that  can partly be explained by the fact that an estimated 70% of sex workers  in the city use condoms, according to health authorities.<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>  Again, though, these figures are largely based on brothel-based sex  workers who regularly visit sexually transmitted infection clinics for  check-ups, rather than street-based workers. In other countries, such as  Honduras and Guatemala, commercial sex work has been noted as a major  driving factor behind the spread of HIV.<sup>19</sup><br />
<h3>Injecting drug users</h3>Drug use is common in many Latin America countries. A number of  Southern Cone countries (those found in the southernmost area of South  America,) have shifted from dictatorships to democracies in recent  history, and this goes some way towards explaining the rise in drug use -  for some people, liberation led to experimentation and excess, as one  Argentinian explained to reporters:<br />
<blockquote class="longquote">&#8220;Around 1986 there was a tremendous  fascination, especially among intellectual circles, with intravenous  drugs. People wanted to try everything, and I think it was in some way a  result, a legacy, of the military dictatorship because during the  dictatorship you couldn&#8217;t do anything&#8221;<sup>20</sup></blockquote>In Argentina, injecting drug use has been a major driving factor  behind the spread of HIV, as infected needles are shared between users.  The same is true in Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay.<sup>21</sup> Cocaine  and heroin are the most commonly injected drugs, with cocaine users  facing the greatest risk of HIV infection because they inject more  frequently than heroin users.<sup>22</sup><br />
Harm reduction programmes, including needle exchanges,  have been implemented in Brazil and are thought to have contributed to  declining HIV prevalence rates among injecting drug users in several  Brazilian cities.<sup>23</sup> <sup>24</sup> Some harm reduction  activities have also been carried out in Argentinean cities. In general,  though, Argentina lacks harm reduction programmes at national, state  and local level.<sup>25</sup> This is despite a severe HIV epidemic  among injecting drug users &#8211; one study carried out in Buenos Aires, for  instance, found an HIV prevalence rate of 44% among this group.<sup>26</sup>  Other Latin American countries face severe restrictions in carrying out  programmes of this kind, due to restrictive laws and a lack of  political support.<sup>27</sup><br />
In several Southern Cone countries, <span class="techterm">&#8216;pasta  base&#8217;</span> or <span class="techterm">&#8216;paco&#8217;</span> &#8211; a form of  cocaine, which is smoked &#8211; has become extremely popular in recent years,  both among poorer populations and the middle-classes.<sup>28</sup>  Although the rise in popularity of pasta base has generally had negative  health implications, there is evidence to suggest that some drug users  have started smoking cocaine in this form instead of injecting it. While  there is currently little solid evidence, this may be reducing the  level of needle-sharing in the region, thereby reducing the number of  people becoming infected with HIV through injecting drug use.<sup>29</sup>  <sup>30</sup><br />
In other countries, such as Bolivia, Peru and Ecuador, the spread of  HIV through injecting drug use has been limited in scope. In Chile, data  are scarce, and in Venezuela the role of injecting drug use in the HIV  epidemic is negligible. However, the availability of heroin is  increasing in these countries, which may lead to a change in the  situation in coming years.<sup>31</sup><br />
<h3>Migrants</h3>Migration occurs on a large scale throughout Latin America. Patterns  of migration have been particularly well documented in Central America,  where civil conflicts and political conditions in the past created a  high degree of movement between countries that continues today.  International migration, particularly between Mexico and the United  States, is also increasingly common.<sup>32</sup> Although it was not  well documented in previous years, studies have now established that the  movement of people is linked with the spread of HIV in Latin America.<br />
Several factors may put migrants in this region at a high risk of HIV  infection: poverty, violence, few available health services, increased  risk-taking, rape, loneliness, and contact with large numbers of sex  workers. In some cases, migrants themselves are sex workers, or resort  to sex work while travelling in order to survive.<sup>33</sup> In one  Mexican study, less than 20% of male migrants reported having used  condoms, and 8% of the women surveyed said they had been raped.<sup>34</sup><br />
As migration increases, the epidemics of individual countries are  becoming less well defined, and the problems surrounding the crisis in  each country are merging.<br />
<h2>Different countries, different problems</h2>Latin America is a vast region &#8211; in some ways it is misleading to  talk about the &#8216;Latin American epidemic&#8217;, because of the scale of the  lands, cultures and populations involved. Although there are many close  links and similarities between countries, it should be recognised that  AIDS in Latin America is not a homogeneous problem, and that each  country faces an unique situation. Below are some examples of the  problems faced in particular countries.<br />
<h3>Colombia</h3>A violent civil conflict between left-wing guerilla groups and  right-wing paramilitaries has raged for decades in Colombia, causing  suffering on a huge scale. Economic decline, violence, murder and drug  trafficking are just some of the results of the fighting.<br />
Gay men, who are more heavily affected by Colombia&#8217;s HIV/AIDS  epidemic than any other group, have faced violent oppression from both  sides of the conflict. Armed groups have also capitalised on the social  fears that surround HIV and have victimised HIV positive people; in one  incident, the AUC (the United Self-Defence Forces of Colombia, the  country&#8217;s most powerful paramilitary force) demanded that all HIV  positive people in Barrancabermeja abandon the city within twenty-four  hours.<sup>35</sup> The AUC has also been responsible for oppressing gay  men. In one reported example, a young gay man was  forced to walk around his neighbourhood naked with a sign reading <i>&#8220;I  am gay&#8221;</i> tied to his neck.<sup>36</sup><br />
On the other side of the political divide, FARC (the Revolutionary  Armed Forces of Colombia) is known to have forced residents of areas  they control to take HIV tests. At least one activist who spoke out  about this policy was forced to flee the country following death  threats.<sup>37</sup><br />
The stigma and discrimination created by these groups is stopping  people from talking about HIV, reducing awareness and therefore putting  more people at risk. It is also hindering HIV prevention programmes, and  campaigns to support and provide treatment for those who are already  living with HIV.<br />
As well as fuelling stigma, the civil conflict has also displaced an  extremely large number of people within Colombia, and caused many to  migrate to neighbouring countries.<sup>38</sup> Since migrants may face a  higher risk of HIV infection, this high level of movement could be  having an effect on the epidemic.<br />
<h3>Honduras</h3>In Honduras, where HIV is mainly spread through heterosexual sex, a  severe epidemic has developed among communities of Garifuna &#8211;  descendents of Nigerian slaves, who have maintained their culture in the  country for over two hundred years. Widespread poverty, poor access to  health care and the popularity of traditional myths about HIV are some  of the factors putting Garifuna communities at risk of HIV infection.<br />
Already highly stigmatised as a minority group, Garifuna now face  added prejudice as a result of HIV.<br />
<blockquote class="longquote">&#8220;If you go to the street and ask the  people about AIDS, many of them think &#8216;AIDS, it&#8217;s not in my house &#8211; it&#8217;s  in the house of the Garifuna&#8221;  <cite>Sergio Flores, doctor, La Ceiba <sup>39</sup></cite></blockquote>Honduras has a large population of people living with HIV and the  high prevalence among the Garifuna community is only part of the  problem. But there is a risk that the stigma surrounding this group will  create a &#8216;somebody else&#8217;s problem&#8217; attitude, where members of the  general population falsely believe that they are not at risk of becoming  infected with HIV.<br />
<h3>Guatemala</h3>In Guatemala, the sizeable Mayan population is another example of a  stigmatised group that may face increased risk of HIV infection. Mayans  generally have a lower socio-economic status than other Guatemalans,  meaning that they have less access to health care services. Many Mayan  communities have trouble speaking Spanish (the most commonly used  language in the country), which also makes it hard for HIV prevention  campaigns to get through to them.<br />
Although the spread of HIV among Mayans has not been fully evaluated,  the results of a small-scale study carried out in one clinic suggest  that Mayans may be three times more vulnerable to HIV than other members  of the population. <sup>40</sup><br />
Indigenous communities in Guatemala have particularly been overlooked  by HIV prevention programmes which need to be more accessible,  culturally appropriate and tailored to their specific health beliefs.  Rising HIV and AIDS rates have been reported amongst such communities.  If their vulnerability to HIV is not seriously addressed, misinformation  and cultural taboos will continue to increase the risk of contagion. <sup>41</sup><br />
<h3>Nicaragua</h3>Nicaragua is proportionally less affected by HIV/AIDS than any other  country in Central America, with 0.2% of the adult population living  with HIV.<sup>42</sup> However, there is currently potential for a more  severe epidemic. One major issue is the stigma surrounding condom use.<sup>43</sup>  Negative attitudes towards condoms may discourage young people from  using them, even though many are aware of the protection that condoms  can provide. One study of adolescents that had been sexually active in  the previous three months suggested that only 21% had used a condom,  despite the fact that most knew that condoms could prevent HIV.<sup>44</sup><br />
HIV testing in Nicaragua is also a concern, as there are currently  insufficient voluntary counselling and testing services. <sup>45</sup>  There is only one central laboratory with government authorisation, and  this laboratory therefore carries out all HIV tests. Because of the cost  of testing materials, stock is sometimes depleted, and HIV test results  can be delayed by up to six months. <sup>46</sup> Such a long wait for  results causes a lot of anxiety for the individuals concerned, and may  dissuade people from accessing testing in the first place.<br />
<h2>HIV prevention in Latin America</h2>Overall, HIV prevention efforts in Latin America have been  small-scale, slow, and largely dependent upon non-governmental  organisations and international programmes.<sup>47</sup> This is partly  due to poverty and a shortage of resources throughout the region, but  lack of political leadership and will has also played a role.<br />
At the same time, several countries have put a lot of time and effort  into raising awareness about HIV, promoting condom use and encouraging  testing, among other schemes. Some of these interventions have been  enormously successful, and have helped to reduce HIV incidence among  certain groups in particular areas. Despite the overall picture, in  terms of individual prevention campaigns Latin America has some of the  strongest and most creative programmes found anywhere in the world.<br />
<div class="photo_r"><img alt="Teacher showing a 
condom in Mexico" border="0" src="http://www.avert.org/media/photos/223.jpg" width="300" /> HIV/AIDS education in a school in Mexico</div>Many of the most effective prevention efforts have taken place in  Brazil, where civil society groups and non-governmental organisations  have helped to fight the stigma surrounding AIDS and to raise awareness  about the subject. The government itself has vigorously promoted condom  use, through media campaigns and advertisements. They have also given  away large numbers of free condoms, distributing 25 million at the 2006  pre-Lenten festival (held annually in Rio de Janeiro) alone.<sup>48</sup>  HIV prevention efforts have focused on high-risk groups such as sex  workers and men who have sex with men, and attempts have been made to  reduce the stigma that these groups face. Needle exchanges have also  been opened in many areas, which has helped to reduce the HIV prevalence  among injecting drug users.<sup>49</sup><br />
Across Latin America, governments have used television, radio,  billboards and posters as means of raising awareness about AIDS. Various  messages have been promoted by these campaigns, including condom  promotion and anti-discrimination messages. In many cases, though, these  messages are not getting through. Young people in particular are often  more likely to respond to folk wisdom and inaccurate information  circulated by their peers than to these adverts. Sex education in  schools can help young people to protect themselves, but recent reports  suggest that the subject is absent in many Latin American schools, and  inadequate where it is available. <sup>50</sup><br />
<div class="photo_l"><img alt="Picture of an

 as 'AIDS is incurable and fatal. You must prevent it.'" border="0" src="http://www.avert.org/media/photos/227.jpg" width="300" /> HIV/AIDS prevention advertisement in Peru</div>Some of the most impressive prevention campaigns in the region have  been carried out through outreach work, which takes anti-HIV messages  directly to the people at risk. In Tijuana, Mexico, a mobile health  clinic travels to areas of the city that health workers usually avoid,  providing HIV testing and clean syringes to injecting drug users.gh outreach work, which takes anti-HIV messages  directly to the people at risk. In Tijuana, Mexico, a mobile health  clinic travels to areas of the city that health workers usually avoid,  providing HIV testing<sup>51</sup>  In Mexico City, a former sex worker runs an initiative that provides  counselling and HIV testing services to sex workers. Along with her son,  she also sits in her car overseeing sex worker&#8217;s transactions and  transporting them to ensure that they have security at work.<sup>52</sup>  In Belize, a government program called Youth for the Future works with  gang members in an attempt to link violence reduction with HIV/AIDS  education. Gang members are provided with information and free condoms,  both on the street and at the organisation&#8217;s resource centre.<sup>53</sup><br />
Although they are no doubt making a large impact in the areas in  which they are carried out, these outreach schemes are only small-scale.  On a wider scale, most countries still need to expand harm-reduction  programmes for injecting drug users, raise a greater level of awareness  about HIV, tackle the stigma surrounding AIDS, improve testing  facilities and encourage more people to use condoms, among other things.  For the most part, governments have neglected high infection rates  among vulnerable groups, and rising rates among the general population.<br />
<blockquote class="longquote">&#8220;[Latin American countries] are far behind  when it comes to prevention for highly vulnerable populations like men  who have sex with men and injecting drug users. My conclusion is it  looks easier for a government to deal with treatment than prevention.&#8221;  <cite>Luiz  Loures, Brazilian epidemiologist<sup>54</sup> </cite></blockquote><h2>AIDS treatment in Latin America</h2>Since highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) became available  to treat HIV in the late 1990s, the distribution of this treatment  across the Latin American region has been impressive. By the end of 2008  an estimated 55% of those needing antiretroviral therapy in Latin  America were receiving it.<sup>55</sup> Considering the poverty that  exists throughout the area, this is quite an achievement - on average  just 42% of those in need of treatment in low- and middle-income  countries are receiving it.<sup>56</sup> It is estimated that, as a  result of combination antiretroviral therapy, people living with HIV in  the Latin American region have gained some 834,000 years of life between  2002 and 2006.<sup>57</sup><br />
Brazil has led the way in terms of ARV provision, with an  internationally renowned treatment campaign. Since 1996, the government  has made treatment provision a priority, and has made aggressive efforts  to drive down drug prices. Under Brazil&#8217;s policy, all people with  advanced HIV infection are eligible for ARVs through the public health  system. This has improved the health of thousands of people living with  HIV, and allowed them to live relatively normal, healthy lives. It has  been reported that deaths from AIDS and HIV-related hospitalisations in  Brazil have fallen by 50% and 70-80% respectively since 1997.<sup>58</sup><br />
Treatment coverage is also high in Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica,  Mexico, Panama and Venezuela.<br />
Elsewhere, ARVs are less widely available. Countries such as  Honduras, Ecuador, El Salvador and Nicaragua have yet to reach half of  those in need. It is generally difficult to find ARVs outside major  cities in these countries, meaning that HIV positive people in rural  areas find it particularly difficult to access treatment.<br />
<h2>Stigma and discrimination in Latin America </h2><blockquote class="bigquoteright"><div class="bigquotebody">&#8220;Is AIDS a big problem in Chile?&#8221; people often  ask me, to which the only possible response is yes: If you get AIDS in  Chile, it is a big problem.&#8221;</div><div class="bigquotecite">Tim Frasca</div></blockquote>HIV/AIDS is not confined to groups such as gay men, injecting drug  users or sex workers - in Latin America or elsewhere. Yet people  continue to associate the epidemic with these groups, which are already  highly stigmatised by people who have moral objections to their  lifestyles.<br />
Additionally, HIV carries its own stigma. Since HIV and AIDS directly  affect less than 1% of the population in most Latin American countries,  the epidemic has a low visibility and many people are ignorant or  fearful of HIV and AIDS. Many people are unclear about the ways in which  HIV can be transmitted, and mistakenly believe that everyday contact  with an HIV positive person will put them at risk.<br />
<blockquote class="longquote">&#8220;[His family] fed him in the same plate  ever, and like that, he had his own cup, glass, fork, knife, spoon, you  get the idea, he was isolated by his own family. His razors where always  trashed, and his tooth brush too, also, no one was ever taking care of  his pills... One week before he died, in the middle of a discussion  because of he having AIDS he was thrown out of his house by his older  sister... he died alone.&#8221; <cite>Lover of an HIV positive man in Honduras<sup>59</sup></cite></blockquote>The following examples further illustrate how prejudice has caused  immense suffering for people living with HIV in Latin America:<br />
<ul><li>In Peru, soccer player Eduardo Esidio was removed from the  University Sports Club professional team when it was discovered that he  was HIV positive. The club&#8217;s directors argued that if he was allowed to  stay, he might be a health risk to other players.<sup>60</sup></li>
<li>In Costa Rica, officials tried to transfer a teacher from a  small-town school when it was found that he was HIV positive. The  transfer was eventually stopped, but only after protests from citizen  groups forced the Ministry of Education to intervene.<sup>61</sup></li>
<li>In Mexico, there have been numerous cases of HIV-related  discrimination involving health-care workers. HIV tests are sometimes  applied to those who are perceived to be at risk of infection without  their consent, and patients who test positive are often isolated from  other patients in a hospital.<sup>62</sup></li>
<li>In Brazil, the results of a study published in 2006 indicate that  children living with HIV in São Paulo face a high level of stigma as  they grow up.<sup>63</sup></li>
</ul>These are just a few examples of HIV-related discrimination, but  situations such as these occur on a regular basis in Latin America. This  is a major barrier to the fight against AIDS, partly because fear of  stigma often prevents people from accessing testing and treatment.  Discrimination also stops people from talking openly about HIV and AIDS,  which leads to a climate of silence in which people are unaware that  they may be at risk. On top of these factors, the prejudice that HIV  positive people face also causes them a great deal of suffering on a  personal level, at a time when they are already dealing with the burden  of being infected.<br />
<blockquote class="longquote">&#8220;Although there is a law against it, my  husband, who is dead now, was fired when they found out he was sick. My  relatives refused to take us in, my daughter and I, because we are [HIV]  carriers&#8221;<cite>Peruvian woman marching on World AIDS Day<sup>64</sup></cite></blockquote>Some Latin American countries have taken steps to address the problem  of stigma and discrimination, mainly through media campaigns to raise  awareness about HIV and AIDS. HIV positive people themselves have done a  great deal to fight this problem, forming citizen groups and standing  up to discrimination through protests and campaigns. Governments must  continue to support these groups, and expand their own anti-stigma  efforts.<br />
<h2>The future of HIV and AIDS in Latin America</h2><div class="photo_l"><img alt="Picture of an HIV 
positive young girl who lives under the care of 'Hogar Amor Y Vida' in 
Honduras" border="0" src="http://www.avert.org/media/photos/172.jpg" width="300" /> HIV-positive young girl, Honduras</div>HIV/AIDS in Latin America is sometimes referred to as a <i>&#8216;hidden&#8217;</i>  crisis: awareness is low, governments have been relatively inactive,  surveillance of those affected is sometimes unreliable and stigma has  stopped people from conducting open and frank debate about the problem.  This is not just an issue within Latin America though &#8211; the  international community has also overlooked the region. In the face of a  more severe situation in Africa, rapidly rising infection rates in Asia  and higher profile epidemics in richer parts of the world, Latin  America has often been neglected.<br />
While it is understandable that more attention has been devoted to  other areas that have been worse affected, many have been frustrated by  the lack of notice given to Latin America&#8217;s epidemics. The tendency of  some people to compare Latin America&#8217;s AIDS problem with those of other  regions is also a point of contention for AIDS activists in the region:<br />
<blockquote class="longquote">&#8220;The suggestion that the region has  somehow been &#8216;luckier&#8217; than others is reprehensible. &#8220;Is AIDS a big  problem in Chile?&#8221; people often ask me, to which the only possible  response is yes: If you get AIDS in Chile, it is a big problem&#8230;  Examining successes and obstacles to future progress is far more useful  than ranking human tragedy on a scale&#8221;<cite>Tim Frasca, author and AIDS  activist in Chile<sup>65</sup></cite></blockquote>The region is gradually gaining more notice from the international  community though, largely due to the success that has been achieved in  providing treatment. As well as continuing to provide ARVs and care for  people living with HIV, prevention schemes now need to be improved.  Efforts to tackle stigma and discrimination must run parallel to these  programmes, because prevention is likely to be ineffective while the  fear and ignorance surrounding AIDS is so widespread.<br />
