<h1>Analysis of Dengue</h1>

<p>
<p>Now-a-days, the  treatment of dengue fever is become clinically. The treatment becomes easier by  determining the symptoms and through examination of body physically. This  mostly applies in the area which is endemic. In earlier times, it became  difficult for doctors to differentiate between dengue fever and of any viral infection.  Now doctors start diagnosing the disease through the fever which is accompanied  by vomiting, rashes, nausea, headache, pain in the body, blood cell become low  in count etc. If anyone is found with these symptoms in the endemic area, they  are sent for proper treatment as soon as possible. These are the warning signs  mainly occurring before the onset of dengue fever.</p>
<p>The treatment  should be suggested to those who are the victims of fever for more than two  weeks. It become difficult for the doctors to distinguish between dengue fever  and chikangunaya fever as there is similar type of viral infection sharing the most  of the symptoms of dengue and occurs mostly in the dengue prone areas. There is  an investigation held in order to exclude the factors which can cause symptoms  similar to dengue. They are Malaria, viral fever of hemorrhagic, measles,  leptospirosis, influenza, fever of typhoid and the last but not least disease  of meningococcal.</p>
<p>The changes  which are earlier detectable in the investigation of laboratory is that the  platelets of white blood cells start declining, which is accompanied by  acidosis of metabolism and also accompanied by low platelets.</p>
<p>In many of the  diseases, it found that there is a leakage from plasma which results in the  situation of hypoalbuminemia and the situation of hemoconcentration. During the  physical examination, there is detection of ascites when it is large but there  will be the demonstration of ultrasound and also the demonstration of fluid at  sults in the  situation of hypoalbuminemia and the situation of hemoconcentration. During the  physical examination, there is detection of ascites when it is large but there  will be the demonstration of ultrasound and also thstage which is the starting of DSS.</p>
<p><strong>Classification</strong></p>
<p>Dengue fever has  been divided into groups by the classification report given by World Health Organization  (WHO) in the year 2009. It is divided into two groups: first is uncomplicated  and second is severe. Severe stage of dengue is the situation where there is  leakage of severe plasma, severe bleeding and dysfunction of severe organs  while the remaining cases are uncomplicated. According to the report of WHO  1997, it is said that dengue has been divided into various fever which are not differentiable.  They are dengue fever and hemorrhagic dengue fever. There is also the  subdivision of fever named by dengue hemorrhagic into the grades from I-IV.  Grade I of hemorrhagic fever is use in the case of easy bruising and also test  of positive tourniquet in any one who is suffered with fever, grade II is the  grade which is present just because of the bleeding in spontaneous in the part  of skins and somewhere else in the body, grade III is act as the evidence for  shock and last grade IV is act in the case of blood pressure and in the case  where the pulse of the body cannot be detect.</p>
<p><strong>Laboratory  Tests</strong></p>
<p>Micro biological  testing of laboratory helps in the diagnosis of dengue fever. The diagnosis can  be done with the help of isolation of viruses in the cell cultures, detection  of viral antigen and in the detection of specific antibodies, detection of  nucleic acid through PCR. It is found that the detection of nucleic acid and  the detection of viral isolation acts to be more correct than the detection of  antigens. But these are the tests which are not easily available because of  their high cost.</p>
<p>The result of  the entire test was found negative in the starting stage of dengue disease. PCR  and the antigen, which is viral, play a vital role in the starting seven days  of the fever. In the year 2012, there was the introduction of the PCR test  which is run on medical equipments used in the process of diagnosing Influenza.</p>
<p>It is found that  the test for dengue virus is only useful in the diagnosing of dengue in the stage  which took sometime after infection. The duration of the lgM and lgG to get  produced is from 5-7 days.&nbsp;The maximum level of lgM is get detected by  following the infection which is in primary stage but the other test of dengue  which is known by the name lgG is produced in the following other stages such  as in secondary stage or in tertiary stage. The lgM is the test which cannot be  determined after few days from primary infection but through re-infection  processes, it becomes easy to detect the lgG over 60 years. Once the patient is  infected with pri as in secondary stage or in tertiary stage. mary infection lgG of the test starts reaching to a level  after duration of 14-21 days in the blood.</p>
<p>Both types of test lgM and lgG provide immune capacity  to different types of serotypes.
