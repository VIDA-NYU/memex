<p>The Thai medical regulator has found no involvement by Thai doctors in any cross-border organ trafficking. That's despite recent reports about organ-donor rackets in Cambodia in which Thai hospitals carried out the transplants.</p>
<p>Cross-border organ trafficking came to light in July when the Cambodia Daily reported that Yem Azisah, a 29-year-old Cambodian woman, was arrested along with her stepfather, Nhem Phalla, 40, who is accused of helping her acquire fake identities for kidney donors.</p>
<p>The Cambodian donors need the papers to prove they are relatives of would-be recipients. This step is required by Thai doctors before transplant surgery can take place.</p>
<p>One of the donors, who is poor and desperately needed money, was persuaded to sell his kidney for about 325,000 baht and was taken to a Bangkok-based private hospital to have his kidney removed, the report said.</p>
<p>The two have been charged with human trafficking and fraud. Last month, the AFP news agency quoted Phnom Penh's deputy police chief Prum Sonthor as saying at least two other Cambodian donors were taken to Thailand for transplant surgery. The report raised fears about a rise in trafficking as part of Thailand's booming medical tourism industry...</p></article>

<p>“Organs trafficking exists because supply and demand are out of balance: if there was more availability of organs, there would be a stop to the illegal trafficking,” So was claimed by Jose A. Nuñez, Medical Officer of the Transplantation Service Delivery and Safety (SDS) of the World Health Organization that has today participated with a delegation of about 80 experts from the Transplantation Committee of the Council of Europe (CD-P-TO) in the general hearing of the Pope, who has once again condemned the illegal sale of organs and stressed that the donation is a testimony of love for our neighbor who must safeguard, however, the certainty of death. European experts have come to Rome for the European Day for Organ Donation which will be celebrated on October 11 with a number of initiatives in several locations of the capital. “Globally, only 10% of patients receive an organ. The formula to reverse this trend is to promote the donation – the WHO expert continued – but at the same time the political authorities should take steps to a tough legislation against trafficking of human beings and organs intended for transplantation. ” ...</p></article>

<p itemprop="articleBody"><strong>HOKSHE, Nepal -</strong> Under crushing financial strain, Kumar Budathoki sold one of his kidneys to organ traffickers for $5,000, a sum he hoped would help set him up for a lifetime free of money problems.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">Instead, he got a lifetime of health problems — and only a fraction of the money promised to him by a shady broker in Hokshe, a village of tiny farms and mud huts that has been the center of the illegal organ trade in Nepal for more than a decade.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">Only about 4,000 people live here, yet at least 121 of them have sold their kidneys, said Krishna Pyari Nakarmi, who has been leading the campaign against the kidney trade in Hokshe.

The scars are easily hidden under a shirt, and many villagers have moved away — possibly after going through the surgery.</p>

<p>The Thai medical regulator has found no involvement by Thai doctors in any cross-border organ trafficking. That's despite recent reports about organ-donor rackets in Cambodia in which Thai hospitals carried out the transplants.</p>
<p>Cross-border organ trafficking came to light in July when the Cambodia Daily reported that Yem Azisah, a 29-year-old Cambodian woman, was arrested along with her stepfather, Nhem Phalla, 40, who is accused of helping her acquire fake identities for kidney donors.</p>
<p>The Cambodian donors need the papers to prove they are relatives of would-be recipients. This step is required by Thai doctors before transplant surgery can take place.</p>
<p>One of the donors, who is poor and desperately needed money, was persuaded to sell his kidney for about 325,000 baht and was taken to a Bangkok-based private hospital to have his kidney removed, the report said.</p>
<p>The two have been charged with human trafficking and fraud. Last month, the AFP news agency quoted Phnom Penh's deputy police chief Prum Sonthor as saying at least two other Cambodian donors were taken to Thailand for transplant surgery. The report raised fears about a rise in trafficking as part of Thailand's booming medical tourism industry...</p></article></li><li><article class="wk-content clearfix"><p style="text-align: center;"><img style="float: left;" alt="UAE" src="/images/UAE.png" />The National | November 2, 2014<br />[<a href="http://www.thenational.ae/uae/emiratis-travelling-abroad-for-illegal-kidney-transplants">read the article</a>]</p>

<p>“Organs trafficking exists because supply and demand are out of balance: if there was more availability of organs, there would be a stop to the illegal trafficking,” So was claimed by Jose A. Nuñez, Medical Officer of the Transplantation Service Delivery and Safety (SDS) of the World Health Organization that has today participated with a delegation of about 80 experts from the Transplantation Committee of the Council of Europe (CD-P-TO) in the general hearing of the Pope, who has once again condemned the illegal sale of organs and stressed that the donation is a testimony of love for our neighbor who must safeguard, however, the certainty of death. European experts have come to Rome for the European Day for Organ Donation which will be celebrated on October 11 with a number of initiatives in several locations of the capital. “Globally, only 10% of patients receive an organ. The formula to reverse this trend is to promote the donation – the WHO expert continued – but at the same time the political authorities should take steps to a tough legislation against trafficking of human beings and organs intended for transplantation. ” ...</p></article></li><li><article class="wk-content clearfix"><p style="text-align: center;"><img style="float: left;" alt="Costa Rica" src="/images/Costa_Rica.png" />Inside Costa Rica |fficking of human beings and organs intended for transplantation. ” ...</p></article></li><li><article c October 1, 2014 </p>

<p><em>Journal of Medical Ethics</em>, 2014, 40(12):821-6</p>
<p>In Canada, there are currently no guidelines at either the federal or provincial level regarding the provision of kidney transplantation services to foreign nationals (FN). Renal transplant centres have, in the past, agreed to put refugee claimants and other FNs on the renal transplant waiting list, in part, because these patients (refugee claimants) had health insurance through the Interim Federal Health Programme to cover the costs of medication and hospital care. However, severe cuts recently made to this programme have forced clinicians to question whether they should continue with transplants for FNs, for financial and ethical reasons.<br />This paper first examines different national policies (eg, in Canada, USA, France and the UK) to map the diversity of approaches regarding transplantation for FNs, and then works through different considerations commonly used to support or oppose the provision of organs to these patients: (1) the organ shortage; (2) the free-rider problem; (3) the risk of becoming a transplant destination; (4) the impact on organ donation rates; (5) physicians’ duties; (6) economic concerns; (7) vulnerability. Using a Canadian case as a focus, and generalising through a review of various national policies, we analyse the arguments for and against transplantation for FNs with a view to bringing clarity to what is a sensitive political and clinical management issue. Our aim is to help transplant centres, clinicians and ethicists reflect on the merits of possible options, and the rationales behind them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;This paper reviews the policy and practice of organ donation and transplantation in Qatar that has developed since January 2011. The important features of the Doha Model (the ‘Model’) are explored, including: (i) all legal residents of Qatar have an equal right to access deceased donor organs and transplantation regardless of their citizenship status; (ii) no prioritisation in organ allocation is given to Qatari citizens; (iii) a multilingual and multicultural education and promotional program about donation has been implemented to engage the diverse national communities resident within Qatar; (iv) financial incentives or fungible rewards for living or deceased donation are prohibited. The ethical framework of this policy will be examined in the light of the national self-sufficiency paradigm, which advocates reciprocity and solidarity among resident populations seeking to meet all needs for transplantation equitably. We review some preliminary evidence of the impact of the Model with respect to engagement of a highly diverse multinational population in a donation and transplantation program, and argue that the Model may inform policy and practice in other countries, particularly those with non-citizen resident populations.</p>

<p>Rising incomes, the spread of personal insurance, lifestyle factors adding to the burden of illness, ageing populations, globalization and skills transfer within the medical community have increased worldwide demand for organ transplantation. The Global Observatory on Donation and Transplantation, which was built in response to World Health Assembly resolution WHA57.18, has conducted ongoing documentation of global transplantation activities since 2007. In this paper, we use the Global Observatory’s data to describe the current distribution of – and trends in – transplantation activities and to evaluate the role of health systems factors and macroeconomics in the diffusion of transplantation technology. We then consider the implications of our results for health policies relating to organ donation and transplantation. Of the World Health Organization’s Member States, most now engage in organ transplantation and more than a third performed deceased donor transplantation in 2011. In general, the Member States that engage in organ transplantation have greater access to physician services and greater total health spending per capita than the Member States where organ transplantation is not performed. The provision of deceased donor transplantation was closely associated with high levels of gross national income per capita. There are several ways in which governments can support the ethical development of organ donation and transplantation programmes. Specifically, they can ensure that appropriate legislation, regulation and oversight are in place, and monitor donation and transplantation activities, practices and outcomes. Moreover, they can allocate resources towards the training of specialist physicians, surgeons and transplant coordinators, and implement a professional donor-procurement network.</p>
