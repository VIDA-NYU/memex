<font size=+2>OVERVIEW</font></h6></center>

<font color="#000000">Plague or black death is an infection of rodents
caused by <i>Yersinia pestis<b> </b></i>and accidentially transmitted to
humans by the bite of infected fleas. The disease follows urban and sylvatic
cycles and is manifested in bubonic and pneumonic forms [note: bubo is
derived from a Greek word for groin]. The Black Death was one of the great
epidemic scourges of mankind. It swept across Europe and Asia in a series
of devastating pandemics during the Middle Ages. This disease was&nbsp;
responsible for the death of one-third of the world's population at that
time. For largely unknown reasons, bubonic plague ceased to be an important
pandemic disease. No major epidemics have occurred in Europe or North America
in more than a century.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">In 2002 two <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5231a1.htm">residents</a>
of New York City acquired plague from New Mexico.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">It is also on the list of possible agents that could be
used by terrorists. Especially since transmission by aerosols results in a very
deadly form of this disease that then can spread from person to person.</font>

<center><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+2>PATHOGENESIS</font></font></b></center><font color="#000000"><i>Yersinia pestis</i> is primarily a rodent pathogen,
with humans being an accidental host when bitten by an infected rat flea.&nbsp;
The flea draws viable <i>Y. pestis</i> organisms into its intestinal tract.
These organisms multiply in the flea and block the flea's proventricuimarily a rodent pathogen,
with humans being an accidental host when bitten by an infected rat flea.&nbsp;
The flea draws viable <i>Y. pestis</i> orlus.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Some <i>Y. pestis</i> in the flea are then regurgitated
when the flea gets its next blood meal thus transferring the infection
to a new host. While growing in the flea, <i>Y. pestis</i> loses its capsular
layer. Most of the organisms are phagocytosed and killed by the polymorphonuclear
leukocytes in the human host. A few bacilli are taken up by tissue macrophages.
The macrophages are unable to kill
<i>Y. pestis </i>and provide a protected
environment for the organisms to synthesize their virulence factors.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">The organisms then kill the macrophage
and are released into the extracellular environment, where they resist
phagocytosis (YopH and YopE; <i>Yersinia </i>outer membrane protein) by the polymorphs. The <i>Y. pestis</i> quickly spread to
the draining lymph nodes, which become hot, swollen, tender, and hemorrhagic.
This gives rise to the characteristic <a href="image/bubo.jpg">black buboes</a>
responsible for the name of this disease.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Within hours of the initial flea bite, the infection
spills out into the bloodstream, leading to involvement of the liver, spleen,
and lungs. The patient develops a severe bacterial pneumonia, exhaling
large numbers of viable organisms into the air during coughing fits. 50
to 60 percent of untreated patients w out into the bloodstream, leading to involvement of the liver, spleen,
and lungs. The patient develops a severe bacterial pneumonia, exhaling
largeill die if untreated. As the epidemic
of bubonic plague develops (especially under conditions of severe overcrowding,
malnutrition, and heavy flea infestation), it eventually shifts into a
predominately pneumonic form, which is far more difficult to control and
which has 100 percent mortality.</font>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Important virulence factors include proteins encoded
by three different plasmids:</font></b>
<ol>

<li>
<font color="#000000">When placed at 37<sup>o</sup> C, low-Ca<sup>2+</sup>
concentrations and in a nutrient rich
environment a plasmid (70-kbps called <b>pYV</b> or pCD1) encodes the Yop
(Yersinia Outer membrane Proteins) virulon and a type III secretion apparatus
called Ysc or Yersinia SeCretion. There are 29 different Ysc proteins which assemble to form
a pore in the inner and outer membrane of the bacteria. Once the bacterium
makes contact with a eukaryotic cell certain translocator Yops will form
a pore in the eukaryotic cell. Effector Yops then go across the channel
formed through the bacterial and eukaryotic membranes and obtain access
to the eukaryotic cell's cytoplasm. There are at least 6 different effector
Yops which when transported into the eukaryotic cells inhibit phagocytosis,
inflammation, and induce apoptosis of macrophages. This plasmid also encodes the
V antigen that appears to also be involved in the type III secretion apparatus.
The V antigen also appears to have immunosuppressive effects on the host's
immune system.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">Virulence is enhanced by another 9.5-kb plasmid (<b>pPst</b>
or pPCP1) that encodes the outer membrane protein plasminogen activator (Pla).
Pla is a protease that interferes with blood coagulation and complement
activation pathways.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">Yet another 100-kb plasmid (<b>pFra </b>or pMT1) also
enhances virulence. It contains the genes for the capsular protein (fraction 1)
and a murine toxin. Some believe the capsule enhances resistance to phagocytosis
by monocytes.</font></li>

days (bubonic).</font>

<p><font color="#000000">Septicemia without lymph node involvement (primary
septicemic plague, 10-15% of the cases); depends on level of lymph node

of bubonic and septicemic plague is disseminated intravascular coagulation
(DIC), pneumonia and meningitis.</font>

another booster at 5-6 mos then 3 more booster shots at 6 mos intervals
followed by 1-2 year intervals until not needed. This vaccine is protective against the bubonic form of plague however, it does not protect against the more lethal pneumonic form of this disease. 
<p>Other investigators are
experimenting with a recombinant fusion protein vaccine consisting of the <i>Yersinia
pestis</i> F1 (capsular protein) and V antigens. So far experiments in murine
models of plague infection have shown great promise in protecting animals against bubonic and pneumonic plague infections. Human safety studies have begun and if all goes well the company producing the vaccine (Dynport Vaccine Company) plans to ask for FDA approval sometime in 2015.
