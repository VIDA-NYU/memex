      <ul>
          <li> ordinary &ndash; the most frequent type, accounting for 90 percent or more of cases </li>
          <li> modified &ndash; mild, it occurs in people who have received the vaccination before </li>
          <li> flat &ndash; rare but very serious </li>
          <li> hemorrhagic &ndash; rare but very serious </li>
      </ul>
      <li><b> Variola minor </b> is the less common and less serious form of smallpox. </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p align="left"><b>How can someone come into contact with smallpox?</b> </p>
<p align="left"> Smallpox can be spread from person to person. Direct and extended face-to-face contact is needed to spread smallpox from person to person. Smallpox is not known to be spread by insects or animals.</p>
<p align="left"> A person can come into contact with smallpox through &mdash; </p>
<div align="left">
  <ul>
      <li> Direct contact with infected bodily fluids or contaminated objects such as bedds not known to be spread by insects or animals.</p>

      <li> Being in an area where the virus is in the air in settings such as buildings, buses and trains (This is very rare).</li>
  </ul>

<p align="left"><b> Smallpox as a weapon: </b> Smallpox can be aerosolized and released into the air quite easily. </p>

<p align="left"><b>What happens if someone gets sick from smallpox? </b></p>
<div align="left">
  <ul>
      <li><b> Incubation period, lasts seven to 17 days, not contagious</b></li>
      <ul>
          <li> People may feel fine and may not have any symptoms </li>
      </ul>
      <li><b> Initial (first) symptoms, lasts two to four days, sometimes contagious </b></li>
      <ul>
          <li> Fever, discomfort, head and body aches, and some times vomiting are present. </li>
          <li> The fever is usually high, in the range of 101&deg;F to 104&deg;F. </li>

      <ul>
          <li> Fever, discomfort, head and body aches, and some times vomiting are present. </li>
          <li> The fever is usually high, in the range of 101&deg;F to 104&deg;F. </li>
        i> At this time, people are usually too sick to carry on their normal activities. </li>
      </ul>
      <li> <b>Early rash, days 1 to 5, contagious</b> </li>
      <ul>
          <li> A rash develops as small red spots on the tongue and in the mouth. These spots develop into sores. The sores break open and spread large amounts of the virus into the mouth and throat. At this time, the person becomes <b>most contagious</b>. </li>
          <li> When or after the sores in the mouth break open, a rash appears on the skin. The rash starts on the face, spreads to the arms and legs, and then to the hands and feet. </li>
          <li> Usually the rash spreads to all parts of the body within 24 hours. As the rash appears, the fever usually goes down and the person may start to feel better. By the third day, the rash becomes raised bumps. </li>
          <li> By the fourth day, the bumps fill with a thick, dark fluid and often have a mark in the center that looks like a bellybutton. </li>

          <li> By the fourth day, the bumps fill with a thick, dark fluid and often have a mark in the center that looks like a bellybutton. </li>
          <li> fever often will rise again at this time and remain high until scabs form over the bumps. </li>
      </ul>
      <li><b> Pustular rash, days 5 to 10, very contagious </b></li>
      <ul>
          <li> The bumps become sharply raised. They are usually round and firm to the touch as if there is a small round object under the skin. </li>
          <li> People often say the bumps feel like BB pellets under the skin.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><b> Pustules/Scabs, days 11 to 14, contagious </b></li>
      <ul>
          <li> The bumps begin to form a crust and then <b>scab</b>. </li>
          <li> By the end of the second week after the rash appears, most of the sores have scabbed over.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><b> Resolving scabs, days 15 to 21, contagious </b></li>
      <ul>
          <li> The scabs begin to fall off, leaving marks on the skin that eventually become <b>scars</b>. </li>

<p align="left"><b>How likely is someone to die from smallpox? </b></p>
<div align="left">
  <ul>
      <li><b> Variola major:</b> Variola major has an overall death rate of about 30 percent. Flat and hemorrhagic smallpox usually are deadly. </li>
      <li><b> Variola minor:</b> This form has a death rate of 1 percent or less. <b></b></li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p align="left"><b>What is the treatment for smallpox? </b></p>
<div align="left">
  <ul>
      <li> Prevention of illness after contact: Health care providers can give out the vaccine. If it is given within 72 hours of contact, the vaccine can either prevent the patient from getting the disease or it will slow the disease process so the person will not get as sick. </li>
