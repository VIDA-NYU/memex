<p align="left"><font size="5">The Variola virus, which is the most virulent member 
  of Genus <em>Orthopoxvirus</em>, is the causative agent of smallpox. It specifically 
  infects humans. The primary reason for infection in humans is due to its ability 
  to evade the host immune responses, and avoid complement activation. Over the 
  centuries, this naturally occurring virus has spread throughout the earth, through 
  various environments, to cause severe outbreaks. The most devastation outbreak 
  had a case-fatality rate of 40 percent in individuals who have not been vaccinated.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="5"><br>
  The Variola virus is a double-stranded DNA virus. It has two envelopes: the 
  outer envelope is present only in the extracellular state. The outer surface 
  or the core membrane, which surrounds the core of the virus, contains lipids 
  and proteins and has a complex symmetry. The core, which has a dumbbell-shape, 
  contains a large amount of the double-stranded DNA (186kbp), about 10 enzymes 
  to mediate gene expression and lots of nucleoproteins- both specific and common. 
  These proteins are involved in DNA transcription, as well as inducing cross-reactive 
  immunity (IOM, 1999). The space outside the core contains lateral bodies &#150; 
  which do not have any known nd lots of nucleoproteins- both specific and common. 
  These proteins are involved in DNfunctions. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="5"><br>
  There are two forms of the variola virus: variola major and variola minor. Variola 
  major is the lethal strain, while variola minor is not lethal, but a mild strain, 
  which is very similar to major but is only genetically different. The most common 
  strain is the variola major, which produces the more severe symptoms, and with 
  a fatality rate of 20% to 40%, within the 7th day of infection. The variola 
  minor is the milder form of the disease that has a death rate of less than 1%. 
  Surviving infection from either strain provides cross-immunity, thereby having 
  immunity to both variola major and minor (Koplow, 2003). An infection of the 
  variola virus starts out with flu-like symptoms, then rashes and scabs form 
  throughout &#150; similar to chickenpox, eventually in fatal cases, leading 
  to malignant diseases such as intravascular coagulation, hypotention, cardiovascular 
  collapse or bleeding of skin and intestinal tract (IOM, 1999).</font></p>

<p align="center"><b><font size="+2">HISTORY</font></b></p>
<form name="" method="post" action="">

<p align="left"><font size="5">The history of the smallpox is still a mystery. 
  It is speculated to have appeared among human population during the first agricultural 
  settlements in northeastern Africa, around 10,000 BC (Baraquet and Domingo, 
  1997). Perhaps the scars, which appear on Pharaoh Ramses V&#146;s delicately 
  preserved mummy dating back to 1157 BC, may be the earliest signs of smallpox 
  exposure (Ellner, 1998). It is speculated that throughout history, exposures 
  to smallpox have been known in all parts of the world, along with the observance 
  of gaining immunity to smallpox upon surviving an exposure. The observance of 
  such a phenomenon throughout history, has led to healthy individuals, to be 
  exposed on purpose in attempts to gain immunity.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="5"><br>
  Inoculation of healthy individuals by placing pus or powdered scab material 
  from an infected individual, to the nose of the intended was recorded by the 
  Chinese as early as tenth century (Ellner, 1998). The procedure of inoculation 
  a healthy individual with smallpox was widely used in England by 1740. Around 
  1765, English physicians noticed that milkmaids were immune to smallpox, as 
  a result of being exposed to the less severe cowpox. As a result, in May of 
  1796 Edward Jenner, a brave scientist, inoculated an eight-year old boy, with 
  the cowpox virus, and was exposed to smallpox. The boy became immune to smallpox, 
  and Jenner was credited for creating the first smallpox vaccine (Barquet and 
  Domingo, 1997). This became the starting point of the attempt to eradicate smallpox 
  on a global scale, which was eventually confirmed and declared by the World 
  Health Organization in 1980. The last confirmed case of smallpox in the United 
  States Occurred in 1949, and the last naturally occurring case in the world 
  was recorded in Somalia in 1977.</font><br>

<p align="center"><b><font size="+2">ENTRY AND MULTIPLICATION</font></b><br>
</p>
<p><font size="5">Attachment of the virus to the host cell is the initial step 
  in infecting an individual (<a href="http://www.rkm.com.au/VIRUS/SMALLPOX/smallpox-life-cycle.html">Life-cycle</a>). 
  Variola usually enters through the respiratory tract. It attaches to the mouth, 
  trachea or lung mucosa. The cells comprising of the mucous membrane are not 
  tightly packed therefore allowing it to penetrate and move into the saliva. 
  Once the virus reaches the cell membrane, it is brought in through endocytosis. 
  Once in the host cell, the core protein in released.</font></p>
<p><font size="5">Variola replicates in the cytoplasm of the host cell. DNA replication 
  and transcription can start immediately because the virus itself contains enzymes 
  for replication and transcription &#150; not relying on host cell enzymes to 
  initiate replication. First the DNA and RNA ploymerase are made, along DNA replication 
  and transcription can start immediately because the virus itself contains enzymes 
  for replication and transcription &#150; not relying on host cell enzymes to 
  initiate r with 
  other transcription factors. Then, the proteins, which form the virion structure, 
  various immunosuppressive proteins, and proteins that bind to certain molecules 
  of the immune system such as TNF, C4b, and IL1 are made. The proteins that bind 
  to immune molecules are either secreted or bound to the infected cell&#146;s 
  membrane. Also, the enzymes, which are to be carried in the newly synthesized 
  virion, are created. The virion then exists the host cell through fusion of 
  the host cell membrane (Koplow, 2003). It is thought that host cell death occurs 
  as a result of having excessive amounts of viral mRNA, which reduces the ability 
  of the host cell in conducting its own transcription and production of normal 
  proteins.</font></p>
<p><font size="5"> The variola virus is able to survive mainly by evading the 
  immune response through several virulence factors. Smallpox has been studied 
  to have a complement-regulatory protein (CRP). The CRP acts a co-factor for 
  the serine protease factor I by cleaving C3b and C4b, which inactivates the 
  complement system, thereby protecting the host cell in which it resides from 
  being hit by the complement-mediated attack (Nature Review, 2002). Also, the 
  ability of the virus to fuse out from the host cell using fusion proteins as 
  a virulence factor is harmful to the host cells &#150; rendering them to be 
  exposed to the extracelluar material, and promote degradation of the cell.<br>
  </font> </p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="+2">SPREAD AND DAMAGE</font></b><br>
</p>
<p align="left"><font size="5">Since the virus only infects humans, it is spread 
  through human-to-human interactions. The virons are usually found in the mouth 
  and nose secretions of the infected individual. It is most often transmitted 
  in air droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. Also, ventilation 
  systems in a building or exposing a cut or wound with contaminated clothing 
  or bedding may be sources of encountering the virion (Mayo, 2002).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="5"><br>
  The exposure to smallpox first leads to an incubation period. In most cases 
  the incubation period ranges from 7 to 17 days. In cases where an inoculation 
  has occurred, in which variola enters through the skin, either on purpose (to 
  produce immunity) or by accident, the incubation time can be dramatically cut 
  down to 2 to 3 days. During the incubation time, the infected individual is 
  not contagious. High fever, and appearance of skin lesions begins the sometime 
  contagious, initial phase. For 2 to 4 days, the infected individual experiences 
  a fever ranging from 101 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit, along with body aches or 
  vomiting. The rash phase is the most contagious. It appears as small red spots 
  on the tongue and mouth, and then progress into sores, which burst open to release 
  virions into the mouth and throat. Within 24 hours, the rash appears throughout 
  the body&#146;s surface, starting with the face and then down to the lower extremities. 
  Within 3 days, the rash will progress into bumps, which eventually fill with 
  a think, opaque fluid. The bump begins to form a crust called a pustule and 
  then into a scab. Scabs may begin to fall off after three weeks from the day 
  the rashes appeared, but the person remains contagious until all the scabs have 
  fallen off (CDC overview2).<br>
  The way the variola virus travels through the body is not clearly known. It 
  travels through the body and infects by a series of activities. It first spreads 
  through the body locally by infecting adjacent cells. It will then enter the 
  lymphatic system and travel around the body to various locations. Traveling 
  through the lymphatic system gives it the ability to reach various organs, which 
  are essential for the survival of the host individual, but it does not infect 
  it. Then it will travel the skin and present lesions, rashes, pustules, and 
  scabs. In some cases such as with the severe - variola major, it can present 
  mild symptoms or more serious problems, as associated with the hemorrhagic and 
  malignant forms. The hemorrhagic form of the variola major can lead to destruction 
  of the entire skin surface and mucous membranes of the body, leading to fatality 
  within 5 to 7 days. The malignant form will lead to excessive bleeding of both 
  the skin and the intestinal tract, leading to fatality (Mayo, 2002). Due to 
  the bleeding, and unable to clot the blood, it can result in cardiovascular 
  collapse, intravascular coagulation, hypotention, swelling of the liver, or 
  hyperplasia in bone marrow and spleen (IOM, 1999). Infected individuals who 
  survive the less damaging strains often have excessive scaring all over their 
  body, and in some cases, may cause a person to go blind (Mayo, 2002).<br>

<p align="center"><b><font size="+2">DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT</font></b><br>
</p>
<p><font size="5">Smallpox has been mistaken with chickenpox, but several observations 
  can differentiate the two. The lesions from chickenpox mainly occur on the outside 
  surface of the skin, but mainly toward the lower extremities and less on the 
  face. Also, chickenpox can readily be contagious prior to experiences symptoms 
  of the infection.<br>
  There is no known cure for a smallpox infection, but if treatment with Cidofovir, 
  an antiviral medication used to treat cytomegalovirss on the 
  face. Also, chickenpox can readily be contagious prior to experiences symptomus (CMV), is given within 
  day 2 of exposure, may prevent an infection (during the non-symptomatic incubation 
  period). The only other choice is prevention through the use of the vaccine 
  (Mayo, 2002).<br>
  The smallpox vaccine is a live vaccine, derived from the vaccinia virus. The 
  vaccine does not contain or cause a variola infection. It provides an individual 
  with immunity for 3 to 5 years, which decreases from after that period of time. 
  The vaccine has provided protection to 95% of the vaccinated individuals. It 
  is administered using a bifurcated (two-pronged) needle. The needles are dipped 
  in the vaccine and once wet, are used to prick the skin a few times in the upper 
  arm (CDC overview2). This process creates a sore spot, which becomes a bump, 
  then a blister with pus, and eventually falls off as a scab after 3 weeks.<br>
  The vaccine will provide protection after 2 days of its administration. It offers 
  the best possible protection against a possible exposure to smallpox. The side 
  effects to the vaccine are usually mild, which include a sore arm, fever, and 
  general body aches. The people who are likely to get serious side effects are 
  those who have conditions, symptoms or illnesses, for which the vaccine is not 
  to be administered. These individuals include those who have eczema or any skim 
  problem or conditions such as burns, atopic dermatitis, herpes, those individuals 
  who have a weakened immune system due so events such as an organ transplant 
  or diseases like HIV, and also to pregnant or planning to be pregnant within 
  1 month after administration of the vaccine. It is not recommended to women 
  who are breast-feeding, to children under 12 years of age. (CDC, vaccine). </font></p>
