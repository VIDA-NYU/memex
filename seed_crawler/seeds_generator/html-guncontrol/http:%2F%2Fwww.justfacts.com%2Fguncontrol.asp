									This research is based upon the most recent 
									available data in 2010. Facts from earlier 
									years are cited based upon availability and 
									relevance, not to slant results by singling 
									out specific years that are different from 
									others. Likewise, data associated with the 
									effects of gun control laws in various 
									geographical areas represent random, 
									demographically diverse places in which such 
									data is available.<p>
									&nbsp;<p>
									Many aspects of the gun control issue are 
									best measured and sometimes can only be 
									measured through surveys,<a href="#f1" style="text-decoration: none">[1]</a> but the 
									accuracy of such surveys depends upon 
									respondents providing truthful answers to 
									questions that are sometimes controversial 
									and potentially incriminating.<a href="#f2" style="text-decoration: none">[2]</a> Thus, Just 
									Facts uses such data critically, citing the 
									best-designed surveys we find, detailing 
									their inner workings in our footnotes, and 
									using the most cautious plausible 
									interpretations of the results.<p>
									&nbsp;<p>
									Particularly, when statistics are involved, 
									the determination of what constitutes a 
									credible fact (and what does not) can 
									contain elements of personal subjectivity. 
									It is our mission to minimize subjective 
									information and to provide highly factual 
									content. Therefore, we are taking the 
									additional step of providing readers with 
									<a style="color: #2E1010" href="guncontrol.fourexamples.asp">four examples</a> to illustrate the type of 
									material that was excluded because it did 
									not meet Just Facts'

									semi-automatic firearm fires one bullet each 
									time the trigger is pulled, ejects the shell 
									of the fired bullet, and automatically loads 
									another bullet for the next pull of the 
									trigger. A fully automatic 
									firearm (sometimes called a &quot;machine gun&quot;) 
									fires multiple bullets with the single pull 
									of the trigger.<a href="#f4" style="text-decoration: none">[4]</a><p>

									during a situation in which they thought 
									someone &quot;almost certainly would have been

									property at home, work, or elsewhere.&quot; 
									Applied to the U.S. population, this amounts

												The Court also overlooks the significance of

									In the First Amendment, no words define the

									publish, or to worship; in that Amendment it 
									is only the right peaceably to assemble, and 
									to petition the Government for a redress of 
									grievances, that is described as a right of 
									&quot;the people.&quot; These rights contemplate 
									collective action. While the right peaceably 
									to assemble protects the individual rights 
									of those persons participating in the 
									assembly, its concern is with action engaged 
									in by members of a group, rather than any 
									single individual. Likewise, although the 
									act of petitioning the Government is a right 
									that can be exercised by individuals, it is 
									primarily collective in nature. For if they 
									are to be effective, petitions must involve 
									groups of individuals acting in concert. ...<p>
									&nbsp;<p>
									As used in the Fourth Amendment, &quot;the 
									people&quot; describes the class of persons 
									protected from unreasonable searches and

									Pages 160-161: &quot;A professional telephone

									&nbsp;<p>
									Page 161: &quot;Each interview began with a few 
									general 'throat-clearing' questions about 
									problems facing the R's community and crime. 
									The interviewers then asked the following 
									question: 'Within the past <i>five</i> years, have 
									you yourself or another member of your 
									household <i>used</i> a gun, even if it was not 
									fired, for self-protection or for the 
									protection of property at home, work, or

									guard.'&quot;<p>
									&nbsp;<p>
									Page 172: &quot;While estimates of DGU frequency 
									are reliable because they are based on a 
									very large sample of 4,977 cases, results

									are based on 213 or fewer sample cases, and 
									readers should treat these results with 
									appropriate caution.&quot;  <p>
									&nbsp;<p>
									Page 163: &quot;An additional step was taken to 
									minimize the possibility of DGU [defensive 
									gun use] frequency being overstated. The 
									senior author went through interview sheets 
									on every one of the interviews in which a 
									DGU was reported, looking for any indication 
									that the incident might not be genuine. ... 
									There were a total of twenty-six cases where 
									at least one of these problematic 
									indications was present. ... Estimates using 
									all of the DGU cases are labeled herein as 
									'A' estimates, while the more conservative 
									estimates based only on cases devoid of any 
									problematic indications are labeled 'B' 
									estimates.&quot;<p>
									&nbsp;<p>
									Page 176: &quot;Another way of assessing how 
									serious these incidents appeared to the 
									victims is to ask them how potentially fatal 
									the encounter was. We asked Rs 
									[respondents]: &quot;If you had <i>not</i> used a gun 
									for protection in this incident, how likely 
									do you think it is that you or someone else 
									would have been <i>killed</i>? Would you say almost 
									certainly <i>not</i>, probably not, might have, 
									probably would have, or almost certainly 
									would have been killed?&quot; Panel K indicates 
									that 15.7% of the Rs stated that they or 
									someone else &quot;almost certainly would have&quot; 
									been killed....&quot;<p>
									&nbsp;<p>
									NOTES: Table 2 on page 184 lists the results 
									of the survey. In keeping with Just Facts' 
									<a href="aboutus.asp#Standards_Of_Credibility">Standards of Credibility</a>, we are using the 
									most cautious plausible interpretations of 
									this data, which is for households (as 
									opposed to individuals) and a five-year 
									recall period based &quot;only on cases devoid of 
									any problematic indications.&quot; As shown in 
									this table, this amounts to 3.456% of 
									households or 1,029,615 defensive gun uses 
									per year. Accounting for the 15.7% figure 
									from page 176 (cited above): 1,029,615 
									defensive gun uses per year × .157 of 
									respondents stating someone &quot;almost 
									certainly would have been killed&quot; if they 
									&quot;had not used a gun for protection&quot; = 
									161,650 such incidents. Using percentages 
									for the same calculation: 3.456% × .157 =

									Annual rates can provide a false sense of

									crime. Upon hearing that the homicide rate 
									is about 8 to 10 per 100,000 population, one 
									feels safe; after all, 1 chance in 10,000 is 
									not very frightening. Actually, however, at 
									recent homicide rates about 1 of every 133 
									Americans will become a murder victim; for 
									black males the proportion is estimated to 
									be 1 of every 30. Similarly, while 16 out of

									The problem lies with people's perception of

									In the UCR Program, a law enforcement agency

									To qualify as a clearance, all of the

									The U.S. Department of Justice administers 
									two statistical programs to measure the

									the Nation: the Uniform Crime Reporting 
									(UCR) Program and the National Crime 
									Victimization Survey (NCVS). Each program 
									produces valuable information about aspects 
									of the Nation's crime problem. Because the 
									UCR and NCVS programs are conducted for 
									different purposes, use different methods, 
									and focus on somewhat different aspects of 
									crime, the information they produce together 
									provides a more comprehensive panorama of 
									the Nation's crime problem than either could 
									produce alone. &hellip;<p class="indent">
									&nbsp;<p class="indent">
									The FBI's UCR program &hellip; collects information

									larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and 
									arson. &hellip;<p class="indent">
									&nbsp;<p class="indent">
									[Regarding the NCVS:] Two times a year, U.S. 
									Census Bureau personnel interview household 
									members in a nationally representative 
									sample of approximately 42,000 households 
									(about 75,000 people). Approximately 150,000 
									interviews of persons age 12 or older are

									[The NCVS] does not measure homicide or

									&nbsp;<p class="indent">
									Second, the two programs measure an 
									overlapping but non-identical set of crimes. 
									The NCVS includes crimes both reported and

									The handgun ban and the trigger-lock 
									requirement (as applied to self-defense) 
									violate the Second Amendment. The District's 
									total ban on handgun possession in the home 
									amounts to a prohibition on an entire class 
									of &quot;arms&quot; that Americans overwhelmingly 
									choose for the lawful purpose of 
									self-defense. Under any of the standards of 
									scrutiny the Court has applied to enumerated 
									constitutional rights, this prohibition—in 
									the place where the importance of the lawful 
									defense of self, family, and property is 
									most acute—would fail constitutional muster. 
									Similarly, the requirement that any lawful 
									firearm in the home be disassembled or bound 
									by a trigger lock makes it impossible for 
									citizens to use arms for the core lawful 
									purpose of self-defense and is hence 
									unconstitutional. Because Heller conceded at 
									oral argument that the D. C. licensing law 
									is permissible if it is not enforced 
									arbitrarily and capriciously, the Court 
									assumes that a license will satisfy his 
									prayer for relief and does not address the 
									licensing requirement. Assuming he is not 
									disqualified from exercising Second 
									Amendment rights, the District must permit 
									Heller to register his handgun and must 
									issue him a license to carry it in the home.<p>

									6. Over 162,000 handguns and 700 tonnes of 
									ammunition were compulsorily surrendered to 
									local police stations between July 1997 and 
									February 1998. The surrender was the main 
									measure in response to the tragic events of 
									13 March 1996, when Thomas Hamilton walked 
									into Dunblane Primary School armed with four 
									handguns and 743 rounds of ammunition and 
									shot dead 16 children and their teacher, and 
									wounded 10 other children and three other 
									teachers. Under the first Firearms 
									(Amendment) Act of 1997 large-calibre 
									handguns became prohibited from 1 July 1997, 
									with owners having until 30 September 1997 
									to dispose of them lawfully, and 
									small-calibre handguns became prohibited 
									from 1 February 1998, with disposal by 28 
									February 1998.  <p class="indent">
									&nbsp;<p class="indent">
									7. As a first step in managing the surrender 
									and compensation schemes, the Home Office 
									and the police needed to contact handgun 
									owners and dealers to ensure that they were 
									aware of the terms of the prohibition and 
									surrender. The Home Office provided booklets 
									for the police to distribute to handgun 
									owners and dealers, explaining the 
									requirements of the legislation and the 
									terms of the compensation. ...<p class="indent">
									&nbsp;<p class="indent">
									13. The Home Office could not provide 
									absolute assurance that no handguns had been 
									unlawfully retained, but was reasonably 
									satisfied that individual police forces had 
									ensured that prohibited handguns in their 
									area had either been surrendered or 
									otherwise lawfully disposed of. The Home 
									Office assured us that individual forces had 
									accurate records of firearms held on 
									firearms certificates. They had used these 
									to follow up firearms which were to be 
									surrendered under the terms of the Acts, and 
									had made adequate checks on handguns claimed 
									to have been otherwise lawfully disposed of, 
									for example by owners sending them abroad. 
									Sixteen of the 26 police forces the National 
									Audit Office visited considered that they 
									had satisfied themselves that all relevant 
									handguns had been traced and those 
									prohibited surrendered. The remaining ten 
									had been unable to account for the handguns 
									held by a total of 35 owners by the end of 
									the surrender period, although by September 
									1998 over three-quarters of these cases had 
									been resolved. ...<p class="indent">
									&nbsp;<p class="indent">
									15. The intention of the prohibition under 
									the 1997 firearms legislation was to remove 
									handguns from civilian ownership, and 
									thereby also from the risk of being used in 
									crime.<p>

									Caution is needed when looking at homicide

									over a long period of time but were all

									counted is the total number of persons

									The interim Brady Law (1994--1998) mandated

									During calendar years (CY) 2002 and 2003, 
									the FBI processed 8.5 million NICS [National 
									Instant Criminal Background Check System] 
									background checks and state POCs [points of 
									contact] processed 8.2 million NICS 
									background checks. ...<p>
									&nbsp;<p>
									The FBI refers to the ATF [Bureau of 
									Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives] 
									the names of all prohibited persons who 
									attempted to or succeeded in obtaining a 
									firearm from an FFL [Federal Firearms 
									Licensee].<p>
									&nbsp;<p>
									... During CYs [calendar years] 2002 and 
									2003, only 154 (less than 1 percent) of the 
									120,000 persons who were denied during the 
									NICS background check were prosecuted. 
									Historically, USAOs [U.S. Attorneys' 
									offices] have been unsuccessful in achieving 
									convictions in many of these cases and 
									consequently have been unwilling to expend 
									their limited resources on prosecuting most 
									NICS cases. ...<p>
									&nbsp;<p>
									We believe that the number of referrals and 
									prosecutions is low because of the 
									difficulty in obtaining convictions in NICS 
									cases. These cases lack &quot;jury appeal&quot; for 
									various reasons. The factors prohibiting 
									someone from possessing a firearm may have 
									been nonviolent or committed many years ago. 
									The basis for the prohibition may have been 
									noncriminal (e.g., a dishonorable discharge 
									from the U.S. military). It is also 
									difficult to prove that the prohibited 
									person was aware of the prohibition and 
									intentionally lied to the FFL. We were also 
									told that in parts of the United States 
									where hunting historically has been part of 
									the regional culture, juries are reluctant 
									to convict a person who attempted to 
									purchase a hunting rifle. ...<p>
									&nbsp;<p>
									CALCULATIONS: 
									 <p>
									8.5 million checks processed by the federal 
									government&nbsp; + 8.2 million processed by the 
									states = 16.7 million NICS background checks
									
									<p>
									&nbsp;<p>
									120,000 denied transactions / 16,700,000 
									transactions processed = 0.0072 denial rate<p>
									&nbsp;<p>
									154 prosecutions / 120,000 denied

									Despite the large number of Brady Act

									Historically, the USAOs [U.S. Attorneys'

									convictions in many of these types of cases. 
									Consequently, they have been unwilling to 
									prosecute most NICS cases. ...<p>
									&nbsp;<p>
									According to Section 1117 of the U.S. 
									Attorneys' Criminal Resource Manual, one of 
									the factors to be used in determining if a 
									particular case merits federal prosecution 
									is whether the potential defendant was &quot;on 
									notice&quot; that his or her possession of a 
									firearm was illegal.<sup>48</sup> Several ATF special 
									agents stated that when they contact 
									individuals, many said they did not realize 
									they were prohibited from possessing a 
									firearm. Some knew that they had been 
									convicted of a crime, but did not realize 
									that the charge was a felony. Others did not 
									realize that they were subject to the 
									prohibition of misdemeanor crimes of 
									domestic violence because they actually were 
									charged with another type of offense, such 
									as assault or disorderly conduct. ...<p>
									&nbsp;<p>
									
									<sup>48</sup> Other factors to consider are the date of 
									the previous conviction, the circumstances 
									under which the firearm was obtained, the 
									existence of indicators of current potential 
									for violence, available alternatives to 
									federal prosecution, and whether false 
									statements were made.<p>

									The special agents we spoke with generally

									factors are often minor or based on 
									incidents that occurred many years in the 
									past. For example, one group supervisor 
									cited a retrieval case in which the person 
									was prohibited from owning a firearm because 
									of a felony conviction for stealing four 
									hubcaps from a car. In another example, a 
									Brady Operations Branch specialist cited a 
									case where the person was prohibited due to 
									a 1941 felony conviction for stealing a pig. 
									We also were told that &quot;bad guys&quot; generally 
									do not purchase their firearms through 
									legitimate dealers; instead, they have 
									someone with a clean record purchase the 
									firearm for them (known as a &quot;straw 
									purchase&quot;) through an FFL, buy a firearm on 
									the black market, or purchase the firearm at 
									a flea market or gun show from a non-FFL.<p>

									After performing additional research, the

									several reasons why this generally occurs: 
									(1) the subject's firearm rights had been

									involved an explosives background check, 
									which was allowed to proceed because the

									under the Safe Explosives Act. According to 
									FBI officials, several of the 272 background

									To estimate the frequency of firearm

									1994 national random digit dialing telephone 
									survey (n = 5,238 interviews). ... National 
									projections based on these self-reports 
									reveal an estimated 1,896,842 (95% CI 
									[confidence interval] = 1,480,647-2,313,035) 
									incidents in which a firearm was retrieved, 
									but no intruder was seen; 503,481 (95% CI = 
									305,093-701,870) incidents occurred in which 
									an intruder was seen, and 497,646 (95% CI =

									the intruder was seen and reportedly scared 
									away by the firearm.<p>

									procedure was used to ensure that 
									approximately one half of respondents were

									the respondent with the most recent 
									birthday. Households occupied by minorities

									&nbsp;<p>
									Summary (page 2 in pdf): 
									 <p>
									&nbsp;<p class="indent">
									The filibuster is widely viewed as one of 
									the Senate's most characteristic procedural 
									features. Filibustering includes any use of 
									dilatory or obstructive tactics to block a 
									measure by preventing it from coming to a 
									vote. The possibility of filibusters exists 
									because Senate rules place few limits on 
									Senators' rights and opportunities in the 
									legislative process. &hellip;<p class="indent">
									&nbsp;<p class="indent">
									Senate Rule XXII, however, known as the 
									&quot;cloture rule,&quot; enables Senators to
									end a filibuster on any debatable matter the 
									Senate is considering. Sixteen Senators<p class="indent">
									initiate this process by presenting a motion 
									to end the debate. The Senate does not vote 
									on this cloture motion until the second day 
									after the motion is made. Then it usually 
									requires the votes of at least three-fifths 
									of all Senators (normally 60 votes) to 
									invoke cloture. Invoking cloture on a 
									proposal to amend the Senate's standing 
									rules requires the support of two-thirds of 
									the Senators present and voting.<p>
									&nbsp;<p>
									Page CRS-10:<p>
									&nbsp;<p class="indent">
									Invoking cloture usually requires a 
									three-fifths vote of the entire 
									Senate—&quot;three-fifths of the Senators duly 
									chosen and sworn.&quot; If there are no 
									vacancies, therefore, 60 Senators must vote 
									to invoke cloture. In contrast, most other 
									votes require only a simple majority (that 
									is, 51%) of the Senators present and voting, 
									assuming that those Senators constitute a 
									quorum. In the case of a cloture vote, the 
									key is the number of Senators voting for 
									cloture, not the number voting against. 
									Failing to vote on a cloture motion has the 
									same effect as voting against the motion: it 
									deprives the motion of one of the 60 votes 
									needed to agree to it.<p class="indent">
									&nbsp;<p class="indent">
									There is an important exception to the 
									three-fifths requirement to invoke cloture. 
									Under Rule XXII, an affirmative vote of 
									two-thirds of the Senators present and 
									voting is required to invoke cloture on a 
									measure or motion to amend the Senate rules. 
									This exception has its origin in the recent 
									history of the cloture rule. Before 1975, 
									two-thirds of the Senators present and 
									voting (a quorum being present) was required 
									for cloture on all matters. In early 1975, 
									at the beginning of the 94th Congress, 
									Senators sought to amend the rule to make it 
									somewhat easier to invoke cloture. However, 
									some Senators feared that if this effort 
									succeeded, that would only make it easier to 
									amend the rule again, making cloture still 
									easier to invoke. As a compromise, the 
									Senate agreed to move from a maximum of 67 
									votes (two-thirds of the Senators present 
									and voting) to a minimum of 60 votes 
									(three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen 
									and sworn) on all matters except future 
									rules changes, including changes in the 
									cloture rule itself.11<p>

									Federalist Paper 46: &quot;The Influence of the

									January 29, 1788.<p>
									&nbsp;<p class="indent">
									The only refuge left for those who prophesy 
									the downfall of the State governments is the 
									visionary supposition that the federal 
									government may previously accumulate a 
									military force for the projects of ambition. 
									The reasonings contained in these papers 
									must have been employed to little purpose 
									indeed, if it could be necessary now to 
									disprove the reality of this danger. That 
									the people and the States should, for a 
									sufficient period of time, elect an 
									uninterrupted succession of men ready to 
									betray both; that the traitors should, 
									throughout this period, uniformly and 
									systematically pursue some fixed plan for 
									the extension of the military establishment; 
									that the governments and the people of the 
									States should silently and patiently behold 
									the gathering storm, and continue to supply 
									the materials, until it should be prepared 
									to burst on their own heads, must appear to 
									every one more like the incoherent dreams of 
									a delirious jealousy, or the misjudged 
									exaggerations of a counterfeit zeal, than 
									like the sober apprehensions of genuine 
									patriotism. Extravagant as the supposition 
									is, let it however be made. Let a regular 
									army, fully equal to the resources of the 
									country, be formed; and let it be entirely 
									at the devotion of the federal government; 
									still it would not be going too far to say, 
									that the State governments, with the people 
									on their side, would be able to repel the 
									danger. The highest number to which, 
									according to the best computation, a 
									standing army can be carried in any country, 
									does not exceed one hundredth part of the 
									whole number of souls; or one twenty-fifth 
									part of the number able to bear arms. This 
									proportion would not yield, in the United 
									States, an army of more than twenty-five or 
									thirty thousand men. To these would be 
									opposed a militia amounting to near half a 
									million of citizens with arms in their 
									hands, officered by men chosen from among 
									themselves, fighting for their common 
									liberties, and united and conducted by 
									governments possessing their affections and 
									confidence. It may well be doubted, whether 
									a militia thus circumstanced could ever be 
									conquered by such a proportion of regular 
									troops. Those who are best acquainted with 
									the last successful resistance of this 
									country against the British arms, will be 
									most inclined to deny the possibility of it. 
									Besides the advantage of being armed, which 
									the Americans possess over the people of 
									almost every other nation, the existence of 
									subordinate governments, to which the people 
									are attached, and by which the militia 
									officers are appointed, forms a barrier 
									against the enterprises of ambition, more 
									insurmountable than any which a simple 
									government of any form can admit of. 
									Notwithstanding the military establishments 
									in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are 
									carried as far as the public resources will 
									bear, the governments are afraid to trust 
									the people with arms. And it is not certain, 
									that with this aid alone they would not be 
									able to shake off their yokes. But were the 
									people to possess the additional advantages 
									of local governments chosen by themselves, 
									who could collect the national will and 
									direct the national force, and of officers 
									appointed out of the militia, by these 
									governments, and attached both to them and 
									to the militia, it may be affirmed with the 
									greatest assurance, that the throne of every 
									tyranny in Europe would be speedily 
									overturned in spite of the legions which 
									surround it. Let us not insult the free and 
									gallant citizens of America with the 
									suspicion, that they would be less able to 
									defend the rights of which they would be in 
									actual possession, than the debased subjects 
									of arbitrary power would be to rescue theirs 
									from the hands of their oppressors. Let us 
									rather no longer insult them with the 
									supposition that they can ever reduce 
									themselves to the necessity of making the 
									experiment, by a blind and tame submission 
									to the long train of insidious measures 
									which must precede and produce it.<p>

									The plaintiff in error contends, that it 
									comes within that clause in the fifth 
									amendment to the constitution, which 
									inhibits the taking of private property for 
									public use, without just compensation. He 
									insists, that this amendment being in favor 
									of the liberty of the citizen, ought to be 
									so construed as to restrain the legislative 
									power of a state, as well as that of the 
									United States. If this proposition be 
									untrue, the court can take no jurisdiction 
									of the cause.<p class="indentdouble">
									&nbsp;<p class="indentdouble">
									The question thus presented is, we think, of 
									great importance, but not of much 
									difficulty. The constitution was ordained 
									and established by the people of the United 
									States for themselves, for their own 
									government, and not for the government of 
									the individual states. Each state 
									established a constitution for itself, and 
									in that constitution, provided such 
									limitations and restrictions on the powers 
									of its particular government, as its 
									judgment dictated. The people of the United 
									States framed such a government for the 
									United States as they supposed best adapted 
									to their situation and best calculated to 
									promote their interests. The powers they 
									conferred on this government were to be 
									exercised by itself; and the limitations on 
									power, if expressed in general terms, are 
									naturally, and, we think, necessarily, 
									applicable to the government created by the 
									instrument. They are limitations of power 
									granted in the instrument itself; not of 
									distinct governments, framed by different 
									persons and for different purposes.<p class="indentdouble">
									&nbsp;<p class="indentdouble">

									Amendment. He was the floor manager for the 
									Amendment in the Senate. In this speech, he 
									introduces the Amendment on the floor of the 
									Senate and explains its purposes.]<p class="indent">
									&nbsp;<p class="indent">
									I can only promise to present to the Senate, 
									in a very succinct way, the views and the 
									motives which influenced th[e] committee, so 
									far as I understand those views and motives, 
									in presenting the report which is now before 
									us for consideration, and the ends it aims 
									to accomplish. ...<p class="indent">
									&nbsp;<p class="indent">
									The first section [of the 14th Amendment] 
									... relates to the privileges and immunities 
									of citizens of the several States, and to 
									the rights and privileges of all persons, 
									whether citizens or others, under the laws 
									of the United States. ...<p class="indent">
									&nbsp;<p class="indent">
									To these privileges and immunities, whatever 
									they may be—for they are not and cannot be 
									fully defined in their entire extent and 
									precise nature—to these should be added the 
									personal rights guarantied and secured by 
									the first eight amendments of the 
									Constitution; such as the freedom of speech 
									and of the press; the right of the people 
									peaceably to assemble and petition the 
									Government for a redress of grievances, a 
									right appertaining to each and all the 
									people; the right to keep and to bear arms; 
									the right to be exempted from the quartering 
									of soldiers in a house without the consent 
									of the owner; the right to be exempt from 
									unreasonable searches and seizures, and from 
									any search or seizure except by virtue of a 
									warrant issued upon a formal oath or 
									affidavit; the right of an accused person to 
									be informed of the nature of the accusation 
									against him, and his right to be tried by an 
									impartial jury of the vicinage; and also the 
									right to be secure against excessive bail 
									and against cruel and unusual punishments.<p class="indent">
									&nbsp;<p class="indent">
									Now, sir, here is a mass of privileges, 
									immunities, and rights, some of them secured 
									by the second section of the fourth article 
									of the Constitution, which I have recited, 
									some by the first eight amendments of the 
									Constitution; and it is a fact well worthy 
									of attention that the course of decision of 
									our courts and the present settled doctrine 
									is, that all these immunities, privileges, 
									rights, thus guarantied by the Constitution 
									or recognized by it, are secured to the 
									citizen solely as a citizen of the United 
									States and as a party in their courts. They 
									do not operate in the slightest degree as a 
									restraint or prohibition upon State 
									legislation. States are not affected by 
									them, and it has been repeatedly held that 
									the restriction contained in the 
									Constitution against the taking of private 
									property for public use without just 
									compensation is not a restriction upon State 
									legislation, but applies only to the 
									legislation of Congress.<p class="indent">
									&nbsp;<p class="indent">
									Now, sir, there is no power given in the 
									Constitution to enforce and to carry out any 
									of these guarantees. They are not powers 
									granted by the Constitution to Congress, and 
									of course do not come within the sweeping 
									clause of the Constitution authorizing 
									Congress to pass all laws necessary and 
									proper for carrying out the foregoing or 
									granted powers, but they stand simply as a 
									bill of rights in the Constitution, without 
									power on the part of Congress to give them 
									full effect; while at the same time the 
									States are not restrained from violating the 
									principles embraced in them except by their 
									own local constitutions, which may be 
									altered from year to year. The great object 
									of the first section of this amendment is, 
									therefore, to restrain the power of the 
									States and compel them at all times to 
									respect these great fundamental 
									guarantees....<p>
