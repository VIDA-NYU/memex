    1          "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security  
               of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear   
               Arms, shall not be infringed."                              

                                     United States Constitution, Amendment II
                                                               Bill of Rights



   
    2          The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to  
               keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect         
               themselves against tyranny in Government.                   

                                                 Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826)



   
    3          The constitutions of most of our States assert that all     
               power is inherent in the people; that... it is their right  
               and duty to be at all times armed;...                       

                                                 Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826)
                              letter to Justice John Cartwright, June 5, 1824



   
    4          The right of a citizen to bear arms, in lawful defense of   
               himself or the State, is absolute. He does not derive it    
               from the State government. It is one of the "high powers"   
               delegated directly to the citizen, and 'is excepted out of  
               the general powers of government.' A law cannot be passed to
               infringe upon or impair it, because it is above the law, and
               independent of the lawmaking power.

    5          All we ask for is registration, just like we do for cars."  
                                                                                        

                                                    Charles Schumer (b. 1950)
                           has sworn an oath to defend the U.S. Constitution
                                                      Press conference, 1993,



   
    6          Waiting periods are only a step.                            
               Registration is only a step.                                
               The prohibition of private firearms is the goal.            

                                                         Janet Reno (b. 1938)



   
    7            All political power comes from the barrel of a gun. The   
               communist party must command all the guns, that way, no guns
               can ever be used to command the party.

    8          We, the People are the rightful masters of both Congress and
               the courts  - not to overthrow the Constitution, but to     
               overthrow men who pervert the Constitution.                 

                                                  Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865)



   
    9          The framers gave us the Second Amendment not so we could go 
               deer or duck hunting but to give us a modicum of protection 
               against congressional tyranny.                              

                                                 Walter E. Williams (b. 1936)



   
   10          ...As we enter the 21st Century, rates of taxation have     
               reached oppressive levels. To statists (who seek only to    
               expand government power), growing resentment on the part of 
               people who work, produce wealth, and pay oppressive taxes   
               presents a serious threat. Disarming ordinary Americans who 
               will be called upon to pay ever higher taxes is seen by them
               as necessary to minimize that threat.                       

                                                       Howard J. Fezell, Esq.

   11          That is why our masters in Washington are so anxious to     
               disarm us. They are not afraid of criminals. They are afraid
               of a populace which cannot be subdued by tyrants.           

                                                                  Jeff Cooper

   12          The thought that average citizens will somehow be better    
               able to successfully defend themselves more effectively than
               our nation's trained professionals is absurd.               

                                                        Handgun Control, Inc.
                                Official statement from Handgun Control, Inc.



   
   13          It is also interesting to note that the top officials of    
               Handgun Control Institute are gun owners themselves. They   
               also intend on keeping them. It's other people's guns that  
               bother them...                                              

                                                                   Mark Urbin



   
   14          95% of all 911 responses are too late to stop the crime!    
                 So, the average 911 caller, terrified for his/her life,   
               has only a 1-in-20 chance of having the police arrive in    
               time.                                                       
                 (But, why call the police in the first place?  Because the
               police are armed!  Well, why are so many people unarmed?   
               Often, because the law required it!  Hmmm.)

   15          When seconds count between living or dying,                 
               the police are only minutes away.                           

                                                           Phillip Van Cleave



   
   16          Gun laws are an attempt to nationalize the right of         
               self-defense. Politicians perennially react to the police's 
               abject failure to prevent crime by trying to disarm         
               law-abiding citizens. The worse government fails to control 
               crime, the more the politicians want to restrict            
               individuals' rights to defend themselves. But police        
               protection in most places is typical government work -      
               slow, inefficient, and unreliable...                        

                                                                James Brovard
                    Quoted in "Dial 911 and Die - The Shocking Truth about...



   
   17          After a shooting spree, they always want to take the guns   
               away from the people who didn't do it.                      
               I sure as hell wouldn't want to live in a society where the 
               only people allowed guns are the police and the military."  

                                             William S. Burroughs (1914-1997)



   
   18          Gun Control is not about guns;                              
               it's about control.                                         

                                                                    Anonymous

   19          Necessity is the plea for every infringement of human       
               freedom.  It is the argument of tyrants; it is the creed of 
               slaves.                                                     

                                                     William Pitt (1759-1806)
                             Speech - British House of Commons, Nov. 18, 1783



   
   20          The desire to order other people around and make them       
               conform to one own's vision takes many forms.               

                                                      Thomas Sowell (b. 1930)



   
   21          The maintenance of the right to bear arms is a most         
               essential one to every free people and should not be        
               whittled down by technical constructions.                   

                                                North Carolina Court Decision
                                       State vs. Kerner, 181 N.C. 574,...1921



   
   22          By calling attention to 'a well regulated militia,' 'the    
               security of the nation,' and the right of each citizen 'to  
               keep and bear arms,' our founding fathers recognized the    
               essentially civilian nature of our economy... The Second    
               Amendment still remains an important declaration of our     
               basic civilian-military relationships in which every citizen
               must be ready to participate in the defense of his country. 
               For that reason I believe the Second Amendment will always  
               be important.                                               

                                                  John F. Kennedy (1917-1963)
                            1959 letter to E.B. Mann quoted:  Gun Digest 1974



   
   23          Nowhere else in the Constitution does a 'right' attributed  
               to 'the people' refer to anything other than an individual  
               right. What is more, in all six other provisions of the     
               Constitution that mention 'the people,' the term            
               unambiguously refers to all members of the political        
               community, not an unspecified subset... The Second Amendment
               extends, prima facie, to all instruments that constitute    
               bearable arms... The very text of the Second Amendment      
               implicitly recognizes the pre-existence of the right and    
               declares only that it 'shall not be infringed.'             

                                             Justice Antonin Scalia (b. 1936)
                                District of Columbia v. Heller, June 26, 2008



   
   24          The fundamental force behind the Second Amendment is to     
               empower the people and give them the greatest measure of    
               authority over the tyranny of runaway government.           

                                                       Bob Schaffer (b. 1962)



   
   25            To prohibit a citizen from wearing or carrying a war      
               arm... is an unwarranted restriction upon the constitutional
               right to keep and bear arms. If cowardly and dishonorable   
               men sometimes shoot unarmed men with army pistols or guns,  
               the evil must be prevented by the penitentiary and gallows, 
               and not by a general deprivation of constitutional          
               privilege.                                                  

                                                      Arkansas Court Decision
                          Wilson v. State, 33 Ark. 557, at 560, 34 Am. - 1878



   
   26          ...the reason that the gun lobby is so powerful, is not the 
               NRA but the basis on which the NRA's power rests; i.e., the 
               Second Amendment. The truth about the Second Amendment is   
               something that liberals cannot bear to admit: The right wing
               is right. The amendment does confer an individual right to  
               bear arms, and its very presence makes effective gun control
               in this country all but impossible.

   28            The nation's murder rate is near a 40 year low and the   
               number of privately owned guns in the U.S. is at an all-time

                 Right-to-Carry states had lower violent crime rates on   
               the average than the rest of the country.  Total violent    
               crime in Right-to-Carry States was 24% lower; murder 
               28% lower; robbery 50% lower and aggravated assault 11%     
               lower.

   29          Good people do not need laws to tell them to act

   32          Laws that forbid the carrying of arms... disarm only those  
               who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes... 
               Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for
               the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to      
               prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with  
               greater confidence than an armed man.

   34          The media insist that crime is the major concern of the     
               American public today. In this connection they generally    
               push the point that a disarmed society would be a crime-free
               society. They will not accept the truth that if you take all
               the guns off the street you still will have a crime problem,
               whereas if you take the criminals off the street you cannot 
               have a gun problem.

   38          This battle for 'common-sense' gun control laws pits emotion
               and passion against logic and reason. All too often in such 
               a contest, logic loses. So, expect more meaningless, if not 
               harmful, 'gun control' legislation. Good news - if you're a 
               crook.

   39          I sympathize with people who want to ban guns, but I can't  
               agree with them.  We have to be careful in our zeal to      
               abolish guns that we don't wind up with counter-productive  
               legislation that will leave armed only the people most      
               likely to do harm with them.

               oppose adding more bureaucratic obstacles that attempt to

   43          In my opinion, neither money nor greed (cupiditas) is the   
               root of all evil. The root of all evil is envy. The         
               non-coper hates the coper, and thus the non-shooter hates   
               the shooter. I see no other explanation for the             
               pointless and irrational activism of the gun grabbers on the
               political scene. They know that their machinations          
               can have no effect upon crime. Guns have no effect upon     
               crime, but they do make all men equal, as the saying        
               goes. This puts the coper on top, and infuriates the        
               non-coper.

   46          In recent years it has been suggested that the Second       
               Amendment protects the "collective" right of states to      
               maintain militias, while it does not protect the right of   
               "the people" to keep and bear arms... The phrase "the       
               people" meant the same thing in the Second Amendment as it  
               did in the First, Fourth, Ninth and Tenth Amendments - that 
               is, each and every free person...

   47          Never Forget, even for an instant, that the one and only    
               reason anybody has for taking your gun away is to make you  
               weaker than he is, so he can do something to you that you   
               wouldn't allow him to do if you were equipped to prevent it.
               This goes for burglars, muggers, and rapists, and even more 
               so for policemen, bureaucrats, and politicians.

   48          Just as the First and Fourth Amendment secure individual    
               rights of speech and security respectively, the Second      
               Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear     
               arms.  This view of the text comports with the all but      
               unanimous understanding of the Founding Fathers.

   49             The provision in the Constitution granting the right to  
               all persons to bear arms is a limitation upon the power of  
               the Legislature to enact any law to the contrary. The       
               exercise of a right guaranteed by the Constitution cannot be
               made subject to the will of the sheriff.

   50          The Second Amendment is not about duck hunting, and I know  
               I'm not going to make very many friends saying this, but    
               it's about our right, all of our right to be able to protect
               ourselves from all of you guys [politicians] up there.

   51          My view of guns is simple. I hate guns and I cannot imagine 
               why anyone would want to own one. If I had my way, guns for 
               sport would be registered, and all other guns would be      
               banned.

   52          Indeed, the tendency among sophisticates to blame inanimate

               mechanism against the principle of personal responsibility.

   55            No matter how many speeches a politician gives in favor of
               gun control, it's a safe bet that his own bodyguards are    
               still packing heat.  Even if he's giving a speech at a      
               school or post office or other gun-free zone.  The Secret   
               Service and other professional-bodyguard types apparently   
               don't trust the ability of "No guns allowed" signs to keep  
               shooters from hitting their targets.                        
                 That's the difference between public servants and the     
               public they serve. Our servants' lives are considered much  
               too valuable to risk in a gun-free zone.

   59          False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real
               advantages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience; that
               would take fire from men because it burns, and water because
               one may drown in it; that has no remedy for evils except    
               destruction. The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are  
               laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are       
               neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes.

   60          The ruling class doesn't care about public safety.          
               Having made it very difficult for States and localities to  
               police themselves, having left ordinary citizens with no    
               choice but to protect themselves as best they can,          
               they now try to take our guns away.                         
               In fact they blame us and our guns for crime.               
               This is so wrong that it cannot be an honest mistake.

   61          We're going to hammer guns on the anvil of relentless

               submission!

   62            ...If "gun control" meant only keeping guns out of violent
               hands, I'd not only use the phrase, I'd support it.  But    
               "gun control" means much more than that.  It has to, because
               every criminal use of guns is already against the law!   
                 It is already unlawful to use a gun to:  rob, intimidate,   
               rape, assault, kidnap, hijack, murder, etc.                 
                  Its purpose is not to control guns, or even criminals.   
               Its purpose is to control people by making them helpless,   
               and thus requiring police (i.e. government) protection.

   63          Expecting a carjacker or rapist or drug pusher to care that

   64          Laws do not prevent any serious crimes, because serious     
               criminals do not obey laws in the first place!  Every nasty 
               criminal activity possible is already prohibited by law, so 
               there's really no further way to legislatively affect the   
               criminal.  (Some psychiatrists explain insanity this way:   
               repeating an action over and over again with the expectation
               of different results.  Restrictive laws relating to peaceful
               American gunowners have never reduced crime, yet with each  
               new law a "different result" of crime reduction is          
               anticipated.  Sounds crazy to me!)

   65          Without either the first or second amendment, we would have 
               no liberty; the first allows us to find out what's          
               happening, the second allows us to do something about it!   
               The second will be taken away first, followed by the first

               course, is not simply an attitude but rather an aberration  
               in which the sufferer clings to an idea which he himself    
               knows to be unsound, such as the idea that inanimate        
               instruments have a will of their own or that lawbreakers    
               abide by the law.

   67          I don't believe anybody has a right to own any kind of a

               firearm, that person should undergo an exhaustive criminal  
               background check. In addition, an applicant should give up  
               his right to privacy and submit his medical records for

   70          [W]hen the resolution of enslaving America was formed in

               artful man, who was governor of Pennsylvania, to disarm the 
               people; that it was the best and most effectual way to      
               enslave them; but that they should not do it openly, but    
               weaken them, and let them sink gradually, by totally        
               disusing and neglecting the militia.

               for you and your children and your grandchildren as

   72          The right of self-defense is the first law of nature; in

               this right within the narrowest possible limits. ... and    
               [when] the right of the people to keep and bear arms is,    
               under any color or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty,

   73          Before a standing army can rule, the people must be

               supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the  
               sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and  
               constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops  
               that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States

   74          Our right to keep and bear arms - personally - is the       
               essential element of political liberty, without which we    
               would stand as mere slaves of any current administration, as
               do most of the people in the world today. We treasure our   
               right to be armed, not only as defense against tyrants, but 
               also as defense against evil men acting alone. Our right to 
               defend ourselves against felons by force of arms protects   
               not only our liberty but also - and this is often overlooked
               - our dignity. Dignity is a word not often used in the Age  
               of the Wimp, for by definition a wimp has no dignity.       
               But dignity remains not only desirable but essential to        
               persons of consequence. This concept is rejected by the     
               socialist, who feels that dignity resides solely in the     
               state. But we Americans are not socialists (at least most of
               us are not) and we prize our unique status in world society.

               liberty; and ought never, but in times of utmost necessity,

   76          Crime is a human behavior problem, not a mechanical problem.
               Furthermore, if firearms were not very useful for           
               self-defense, then police wouldn't carry them.              
               In a free country, if the government can go armed,          
               so should the citizens, if they so choose.

   77          Firearms have been around for over 400 years, yet it is only
               in the last 20 years that people have begun shouting "gun   
               control".  Why then, only recently, has this become such an 
               issue?  Moreover, why are there more mass-murderers than at 
               any other time in our known history?  It is not because     
               weapons are more powerful - 200-year-old muzzleloaders have
               a much greater force-per-round than today's "assault        
               rifles".  It is not because weapons are semi- or            
               fully-automatic - rapid-fire weapons have been available   
               for most of the last century. It is not due to a lack of    
               laws - we have more "gun control" laws than ever. It IS,   
               however, because we have chosen to focus on "gun control"   
               instead of crime control or "thug control." It IS because   
               only recently has the public become complacent enough to    
               accept, by inaction, the violence present in our society.

   79          But to ban guns because criminals use them is to tell the   
               innocent and law-abiding that their rights and liberties    
               depend not on their own conduct, but on the conduct of the  
               guilty and the lawless, and that the law will permit them to
               have only such rights and liberties as the lawless will     
               allow. ... For society does not control crime, ever, by     
               forcing the law-abiding to accommodate themselves to the    
               expected behavior of criminals. Society controls crime by   
               forcing the criminals to accommodate themselves to the      
               expected behavior of the law-abiding.

   80          A government that intended to protect the liberty of the    
               people would not disarm them. A government planning the     
               opposite most certainly and logically would disarm them. And
               so it has been in this century.  Check out the history of

   81            They [the makers of our Constitution] conferred, as       
               against the government, the right to be let alone - the most
               comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by        
               civilized men.                                              
                 Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to     
               protect liberty when the government's purposes are          
               beneficial ... the greatest dangers to liberty lurk in      
               insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well meaning but     
               without understanding.

   82              What, Sir, is the use of a militia? It is to prevent the
               establishment of a standing army, the bane of liberty....   
               Whenever Governments mean to invade the rights and liberties
               of the people, they always attempt to destroy the militia,  
               in order to raise an army upon their ruins.

   83          It would also be strange to find in the midst of a catalog  
               of the rights of individuals a provision securing to the    
               states the right to maintain a designated "Militia."        
               Dispassionate scholarship suggests quite strongly that the  
               right of the people to keep and bear arms meant just that.

   84            "The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not  
               be infringed."  The right of the whole people, old and      
               young, men, women and boys, and not militia only, to keep   
               and bear arms of every description, and not such merely as  
               are used by the militia, shall not be infringed, curtailed,  
               or broken in upon, in the smallest degree; and all this for 
               the important end to be attained: the rearing up and        
               qualifying a well-regulated militia, so vitally necessary to
               the security of a free State. Our opinion is that any law,  
               State or Federal, is repugnant to the Constitution, and     
               void, which contravenes this right.

   85          When a commissioned officer takes the oath, he swears       
                 "To support and defend the Constitution of the United      
                 States of America against all enemies foreign and          
                 domestic."                                                 
               We know about these foreign enemies of the US Constitution, 
               but who are the "domestics"?  For my money the most         
               conspicuous domestic enemy whom I have sworn to confound is 
               the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.                
                 It is not clear to me that the BATF does anything that    
               needs doing. Contrarily, it does a great deal that does     
               not need doing. I do not know how many people are currently 
               employed by this unpleasant agency, but I do feel it to be  
               my duty to support the US Constitution against domestic     
               enemies by advocating abolition of the BATF.  I have been   
               told by people in Washington that when I make statements    
               like this, I am laying my head on the block. So be it.      
               Better men than I have done just that.

   87          As I have stood in the crosshairs of those who target Second
               Amendment freedoms, I've realized that firearms are not the 
               only issue.  No, it's much, much bigger than that. I've come
               to understand that a cultural war is raging across our land,
               in which, with Orwellian fervor, certain acceptable thoughts
               and speech are mandated.

   88          Registration today always leads to confiscation later.      
               "We're only asking for registration today because we want to
               be able to trace a gun back to its rightful owner," they    
               claim.  That's what the City of New York told it's residents
               years ago.  That's what Great Britain and Australia told    
               their citizens years ago.  And in all those places the      
               government went back on its word and banned guns...Naturally
               compliance has not been 100%, so the government threatens   
               holdouts with 4 years in prison and $100,000 fines.  It then
               uses the registration lists to go house-to-house and        
               forcibly steal private property....leaving the people          
               defenseless against the new violent crimes that predictably 
               followed...

   89          I have not one doubt, even if I am in agreement with the    
               National Rifle Association, that that kind of record keeping
               procedure (gun registration) is the first step to eventual  
               confiscation under one administration or another

   90          You need only reflect that one of the best ways to get      
               yourself a reputation as a dangerous citizen these days is  
               to go about repeating the very phrases which our founding   
               fathers used in the struggle for independence.              

                                                Charles A. Beard (1874-1948) 



   
   91            In my studies as an attorney and as a United States       
               Senator, I have constantly been amazed by the indifference  
               or even hostility shown the Second Amendment by courts,     
               legislatures, and commentators.                             
                 James Madison would be startled to hear that his          
               recognition of a right to keep and bear arms, which passed  
               the House by a voice vote without objection and hardly a    
               debate, has since been construed in but a single, and most  
               ambiguous Supreme Court decision, whereas his proposals for 
               freedom of religion, which he made reluctantly out of fear  
               that they would be rejected or narrowed beyond use, and        
               those for freedom of assembly, which passed only after a    
               lengthy and bitter debate, are the subject of scores of     
               detailed and favorable decisions.                           
                 Thomas Jefferson, who kept a veritable armory of pistols, 
               rifles and shotguns at Monticello, and advised his nephew to
               forsake other sports in favor of hunting, would be astounded
               to hear supposed civil libertarians claim firearm ownership 
               should be restricted.                                       
                 Samuel Adams, a handgun owner who pressed for an amendment
               stating that the "Constitution shall never be construed...to
               prevent the people of the United States who are peaceable
               citizens from keeping their own arms, would be shocked to      
               hear that his native state today imposes a year's sentence, 
               without probation or parole, for carrying a firearm without 
               a police permit.

   92          The founders faced the very same kind of abuses of power we 
               experience today, outrage in abuses of powers. The founders 
               declared that we, the people, are the sovereign, and not the
               government. As with all sovereigns, it is we who have the   
               monopoly on force, and we delegate what we want to without  
               surrendering any of our own. As the sovereign, the monopoly 
               on force is only one part of our total authority: the       
               electorate's direction of servants is being defied in nearly
               every single issue and crisis, not only in violent crime.   
               Gun rights and freedoms are a very sensitive bellwether of  
               future abuses of all rights like broken windows are a          
   92          bellwether of urban blight... Some have lost sight of what  
               it is to be free.

   93          The National Firearms Act fit in perfectly with the         
               systematic creation of government programs and deficit      
               spending that Franklin Roosevelt immediately began to       
               institute the instant he took office. The NFA was a model    
               vehicle for the continued expansion of government power: It 
               was arbitrary (i.e. the 18-inch rule); it gave the          
               government sweeping authority over something very common; it
               focused on inanimate objects rather than criminal behavior; 
               it levied draconian taxes on these objects; and most        
               importantly, it created millions of criminals with the      
               stroke of a pen, just as Prohibition had.                   

                                                                    John Ross

   94          ... That the United States was born out of an armed         
               rebellion fueled, in large part, by resentment over         
               excessive taxation is a bit of history that makes statists  
               extremely uncomfortable. It should, therefore, come as no   
               surprise that congressmen and senators who dream of an      
               ever-expanding welfare state consistently vote to restrict  
               individual gun ownership or even ban the production of      
               certain classes of firearms....

               gangsters. I want you to have nothing. If I'm a bad guy, I'm
               always gonna have a gun. Safety Locks? You will pull the    
               trigger with a lock on, and I'll pull the trigger. We'll see
               who wins.

  105          There are some weapons that are just so dangerous           
               that society has a right and the obligation even            
               to take those weapons out of circulation.

  106            Every Swiss man from 18 to 50 has a fully automatic       
               "assault rifle" with a 25-round mags, and ammo.  His rifle  
               is not stored at the army base (as here) - he gets to keep  
               it at home!...Yet criminal use of these powerful weapons is 
               almost unheard of.  Also, the Swiss have no gun restrictions
               for sane non-felon adults.  Buy what you want, and carry it 
               where you want to.                                          
                 You see, the Swiss government and the Swiss citizens trust
               each other, because they are the same people....versus here
               where we suffer a professional political class ruling from  
               on high what they to be their "subjects."

  107          I do not believe in people owning guns. Guns should be owned
               only by the police and military. I am going to do everything
               I can to disarm this state.

  108            Only Vermont perfectly recognizes your right to be        
               peaceably armed without permit - openly or concealed.  So,  
               Sarah Brady and Josh Sugarmann - why isn't Vermont a hotbed 
               or gun violence when it should be by your arguments?        
                 Conversely, why is Washington, D.C., where they've banned 
               handgun ownership, our nation's murder capital?  CHL states 
               have lower crime rates.  This is indisputable.  Every Swiss 
               male keeps at home his fully-automatic, militia-issued rifle 
               (along with grenades, mortars, etc.), and Switzerland has   
               the lowest crime rate in the West.

  109          We are fast approaching the stage of the ultimate inversion:
               the stage where the government is free to do anything it    
               pleases, while the citizens may act only by permission;     
               which is the stage of the darkest periods of human history, 
               the stage of rule by brute force.

  118          I honestly think - and I am not an expert on the amendments 
               - I think the only people in this nation who should be      
               allowed to own guns are police officers. I don't care if you
               want to hunt, I don't care if you think it's your right. I  
               say, 'Sorry. It is 1999, we have had enough as a nation. You
               are not allowed to own a gun and if you do own a gun, I     
               think you should go to prison.'

  120          I want to make it as hard as possible. Gun owners would have
               to be evaluated by how they scored on written and firing    
               tests, and have to pass the tests in order to own a gun. And
               I would tax the guns, bullets and the license itself very   
               heavily.

  121          The history of liberty is a history of limitation of

               exceptions besides cases of conscience, to be provided with 
               arms and ammunition... is always a wise institution, and, in
               the present circumstances of our country, indispensable.

  123          [Washington D.C. is the nation's Murder Capital with a      
               murder rate of 78 per 100,000] "But how can that be when    
               Washington, D.C. has a total ban on privately-owned         
               handguns?...And yes, criminals often do get their illegal   
               guns from Virginia and other neighboring or nearby states.  
               But here's what I can't figure out:  If guns cause crime, or
               if easy criminal access to guns causes crime, then why      
               doesn't Virginia suffer a murder rate like Washington,

                 Criminals in both places can get guns.  In Washington,    
               D.C., however, law abiding citizens cannot get guns.  Thus     
               they can't protect themselves, so they much more often get  
               murdered.  Simple, isn't it?

               * In 1929, the Soviet Union established gun control. From   
               1929 to 1953, about 20 million dissidents, unable to defend 
               themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.   
            
               * In 1911, Turkey established gun control. From 1915 to     
               1917, 1.5 million Armenians, unable to defend themselves,   
               were rounded up and exterminated.          
                 
               * Germany established gun control in 1938 and from 1939 to     
               1945, a total of 13 million Jews and others who were unable 
               to defend themselves were rounded up and exterminated.  
   
               * China established gun control in 1935. From 1948 to 1952, 
               20 million political dissidents, unable to defend           
               themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.   
            
               * Guatemala established gun control in 1964. From 1964 to   
               1981, 100,000 Mayan Indians, unable to defend themselves,   
               were rounded up and exterminated.          
                    
               *  Uganda established gun control in 1970. From 1971 to     
               1979, 300,000 Christians, unable to defend themselves, were 
               rounded up and exterminated.               
                 
               * Cambodia established gun control in 1956. From 1975 to    
               1977, one million 'educated' people, unable to defend       
               themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.   
           
               *  Defenseless people rounded up and exterminated in the    
               20th Century because of gun control: 56 million.               
               The tragic history of civilian disarmament cries a warning  
               against any systematic attempts to render innocent citizens 
               ill-equipped to defend themselves from tyrant terrorists,   
               despots or oppressive majorities.

  128          Before Adolf Hitler came to power, there was a black market 
               in firearms, but the German people had been so conditioned  
               to be law abiding that they would never consider buying an  
               unregistered gun. The German people really believed that    
               only hoodlums own guns. What fools we were. It truly        
               frightens me to see how the government, media and some      
               police groups in America are pushing for the same mindset.

  129           At Waco, was there really an urgency to get those people   
               out of the compound at that particular time? Was the press  
               going to make it look heroic for the Bureau of Alcohol,     
               Tobacco, and Firearms?                                      
                At Ruby Ridge, there was one guy in a cabin at the top of  
               the mountain. Was it necessary for federal agents to go up  
               there and shoot a 14-year-old in the back and shoot a woman 
               with a child in her arms? What kind of mentality does that?

  134          The Second Amendment is a doomsday provision, one designed  
               for those exceptionally rare circumstances where all other  
               rights have failed - where the government refuses to stand  
               for reelection and silences those who protest; where courts 
               have lost the courage to oppose, or can find no one to      
               enforce their decrees. However improbable these             
               contingencies may seem today, facing them unprepared is a   
               mistake a free people get to make only once.

  135          The American Revolution would never have happened with gun  
               control.                                                    

                                                                    Anonymous



   
  136          One of the arguments that had been made against gun control 
               was that an armed citizenry was the final bulwark against   
               tyranny. My response had been that untrained, lightly-armed 
               non-soldiers couldn't prevail against a modern army.        
               I had concluded that the qualitative difference in firepower
               was such that all of the previous rules of guerilla war no  
               longer applied.  Both Vietnam and Afghanistan demonstrated  
               that wasn't true.  Repelling an armed invasion is not       
               something that American citizens are likely to face, but the
               possibility of a despotic government coming to power is not 
               wholly unthinkable.  One of the sequellae of Vietnam was the   
               rise of the Khmer Rouge and slaughter of perhaps a million  
               Cambodian citizens.  Those citizens, like the Jews in       
               Germany or the Armenians in Turkey, were unarmed and thus   
               utterly and completely defenseless against police and       
               paramilitary. An armed minority was able to kill and        
               terrorize unarmed victims with total impunity.

  137          Gun control has not worked in D.C.  The only people who have
               guns are criminals.  We have the strictest gun laws in the  
               nation and one of the highest murder rates.  It's quicker to
               pull your Smith & Wesson than to dial 911 if you're being   
               robbed.

  138            If gun laws in fact worked, the sponsors of this type of  
               legislation should have no difficulty drawing upon long     
               lists of examples of crime rates reduced by such            
               legislation.  That they cannot do so after a century and a  
               half of trying-that they must sweep under the rug the      
               southern attempts at gun control in the 1870-1910 period,   
               the northeastern attempts in the 1920-1939 period, the      
               attempts at both Federal and State levels in                
               1965-1976-establishes the repeated, complete and inevitable
               failure of gun laws to control serious crime.

  140          Have you ever heard of a mass shooting in a police station, 
               at a pistol range, or at a gun show? Suicidal mass murderers
               may be insane, but they are not necessarily stupid. They    
               always select a soft target for their final acts of         
               violence. This principle also applies to many other types of
               crime.

                                                The Tragedy of Gun Free Zones



   
  141          ...All three attacks took place in areas where gun          
               possession by those who did the attack as well as civilians 
               generally was already banned - so-called "gun-free safe     
               zones." Suppose you or your family are being stalked by a   
               criminal who intends on harming you. Would you feel safer   
               putting a sign in front of your home saying "This Home is a 
               Gun-Free Zone"?                                             
                 It is pretty obvious why we don't put these signs up. As  
               with many other gun laws, law-abiding citizens, not would-be
               criminals, would obey the sign. Instead of creating a safe  
               zone for victims, it leaves victims defenseless and creates    
               a safe zone for those intent on causing harm.

  142          We all remember the happy day when the town of Kennesaw,     
               Georgia, passed an ordinance requiring householders to      
               maintain an appropriate firearm in every house. The         
               hoplophobes, of course, were horrified.  Being hoplophobes, 
               they did not need to make sense. It is nonetheless          
               gratifying to note that crime, which was very unusual in    
               Kennesaw, Georgia, has decreased steadily since the passing  
               of the ordinance. If you mention this to those other people,
               they have nothing to say, and simply change the subject.    
               Actually that is the only valid position that these         
               disarmers can take - change the subject!

  143          All anti-gun nuts can see is the gun. They cannot see       
               themselves coming to the aid of another...

               you, but you also know I hate guns. I don't hate criminals, 
               I hate guns, so you need to know this about me: if our home 
               is ever burgled, invaded, or if we encounter anything like  
               that away from home, you need to know that you can't count  
               on me to protect you and the kids. I thought you'd like to

                 Anti-gun activists don't realize what they are doing to

               cannot even see that the shooters are persons for whom guns 
               are already banned. Doesn't work, does it? It is the        
               prohibited persons who are troubled persons to begin with.  
               It is the felons who are prohibited from even possessing a  
               gun who are doing the shootings. So much for profiling      
               shooters. So much for gun control. What an idiotic concept  
               to disarm the citizens and oneself, and be unable to disarm 
               the prohibited persons. Being unarmed is the perfect excuse 
               not to defend your wife and kids

  144          In a comprehensive study of all public multiple shooting    
               incidents in America between 1977 and 1999, economists John 
               Lott and Bill Landes found that the only public policy that 
               reduced both the incidence and casualties of such shootings 
               were concealed-carry laws. Not only are there 60 percent    
               fewer gun massacres after states adopt concealed-carry laws,
               but the death and injury rate of such rampages are reduced  
               by 80 percent.

  145          Let me make a point here, in case this isn't becoming       
               extremely clear. My state has gun control laws. It did not  
               keep Hennard from coming in and killing everybody!  What it  
               did do, was keep me from protecting my family! That's the

  146          To my mind it is wholly irresponsible to go into the world  
               incapable of preventing violence, injury, crime, and death. 
               How feeble is the mindset to accept defenselessness. How    
               unnatural. How cheap. How cowardly. How pathetic.

  147          For among other evils caused by being disarmed, it renders

  150          Gun control is a band-aid, feeling good approach to the     
               nation's crime problem. It is easier for politicians to ban 
               something than it is to condemn a murderer to death or a    
               robber to life in prison. In essence, 'gun control' is the  
               coward's way out.

  151          [T]he Clinton administration launched an attack on people in
               Texas because those people were religious nuts with guns.   
               Hell, this country was founded by religious nuts with guns. 
               Who does Bill Clinton think stepped ashore on Plymouth Rock?
               Peace Corps volunteers? Or maybe the people in Texas were   
               attacked because of child abuse. But, if child abuse was the
               issue, why didn't Janet Reno tear-gas Woody Allen?

  154          Gun Control helps massacres to succeed.                     
                 Analyzing history's mass murders for common criteria has  
               proven very illuminating.  There is a formula, and it is   
               nearly 100% accurate.  It is this:                          
                 Person with evil intent to kill many people               
                   + Any deadly weapon                                     
                   + Guarantee that the intended victims can't fight back  
                   + Expectation that police won't prevent killing         
                   = Mass murder                                           
               ...The "gun free school zones" are places where mass        
               murderers know they won't be resisted.  Conversely they        
               don't go to gun shows, police stations....Disarming ordinary
               Americans isn't the answer - it is the problem!  (Declaw    
               your housecat and see how long she lasts in the wild.)

  155          Gun control does not decrease gun ownership by criminals but
               instead reduces their incentives to refrain from violence   
               because it decreases the supply of armed law-abiding        
               citizens who might resist them."

  156          The Florida tourist-shooting epidemic is also relevant in   
               another way.  Once the airport rental lots started removing 
               their big florescent rent-a-car stickers Florida's "tourist 
               murder crime wave" disappeared virtually overnight.         
               (Because criminals rightly figured that                     
               out-of-town tourists weren't armed like Floridians were.)   
               Similarly, one of the last places a criminal knows he can   
               find unarmed victims in an increasingly well-armed and      
               peaceful America today ... is in the "gun free school zones"
               in which the snivelliberals have locked up our children.

  157          No, we're not looking at how to control criminals... we're  
               talking about banning the AK-47 and semi-automatic guns.

  158          Passing a law like the assault weapons ban is a symbolic -  
               purely symbolic - move in that direction. Its only real     
               justification is not to reduce crime but to desensitize the 
               public to the regulation of weapons in preparation for their
               ultimate confiscation.

  159          ...I am opposed to all attempts to license or restrict the  
               arming of individuals... I consider such laws a violation of
               civil liberty, subversive of democratic political           
               institutions, and self-defeating in their purpose.

  160          Why are guns the only unregulated consumer products in      
               America? We regulate toy guns and teddy bears, but we do not
               regulate a product that kills 4,600 children a year.

  161          And when something as terrible as Columbine's tragedy occurs
               - politicians immediately look for a scapegoat such as the  
               NRA. They immediately seek to pass more restrictive laws    
               that continue to erode away our personal and private        
               liberties. We do not need more restrictive laws. Eric and   
               Dylan would not have been stopped by metal detectors. No    
               amount of gun laws can stop someone who spends months       
               planning this type of massacre. The real villain lies within
               our own hearts. Political posturing and restrictive         
               legislation are not the answers.

                          Subcommittee on Crime House Judiciary, may 27, 1999



   
  162          The NRA is right...handgun controls do little to stop       
               criminals from obtaining handguns.

  163          As much as I oppose the average person's having a gun, I    
               recognize that some people [elite citizens?] have a         
               legitimate need to own one. A wealthy corporate executive   
               who fears his family might get kidnapped is one such person.
               A Hollywood celebrity who has to protect himself from kooks 
               is another. If Sharon Tate had had access to a gun during   
               the Manson killings, some innocent lives might have been    
               saved.                                                      

                                                              Joseph McNamara

  164          Good intentions will always be pleaded for every assumption 
               of authority. It is hardly too strong to say that the       
               Constitution was made to guard the people against the       
               dangers of good intentions. There are men in all ages who   
               mean to govern well, but they mean to govern. They promise  
               to be good masters, but they mean to be masters.            

                                                    Daniel Webster (1782-1852)



   
  165            I wanted to know why the state treats teachers like       
               second-class citizens, when plumbers and doctors are allowed
               to protect themselves on the job," she said. "I would be    
               happier sending my child to a school where a teacher whom I 
               trust is armed and well prepared.                           
                 We have created a shopping list for madmen," she said. "If
               guns are the problem, why don't we see things occurring at  
               skeet and trap shoots, at gun shows, at NRA conventions? We 
               only see it where guns aren't allowed. The sign of a gun    
               with a slash through it is like a neon sign for gunmen,     
               'We're unarmed. Come kill us.'

  170          If the constitutional right to keep and bear arms is to mean

               ultimate goal - total control of all guns - is going to take
               time.....The final problem is to make the possession of all

  173          As nightfall does not come at once, neither does oppression.
               In both instances, there is a twilight when everything      
               remains seemingly unchanged. And it is in such a twilight   
               that we all must be most aware of change in the air -       
               however slight - lest we become the unwitting victims of the
               darkness.

  174          A system of licensing and registration is the perfect device

               see the danger in the big picture.  They're courting        
               disaster by encouraging others to use the same means to     
               eliminate portions of the Constitution they don't like.

               The use of questions to point out fundamental illogic, which
               can then topple the notions a person builds on that flawed  
               base. An application of the Socratic method. The mental     
               awareness that forms when a simple question challenges      
               fundamentally held beliefs. Here are many. [Only a few      
               given as an example] One at a time is usually enough for

                   * Are criminals and an armed citizenry the same thing?     
                   * Should it be against the law to defend yourself?      
                   * Do you believe that only the rulers should have the

                   * Now let me see if I understand this; when you say "gun
               control," do you mean "stop crime" or "disarm the public"?  
                   * Now let me see if I understand this; when you say     
               you're anti gun, do you mean you want to disarm the police

  185            Listen hard when you hear the term "gun control" in the   
               news. You'll notice they're usually not talking about       
               controlling crime. They're talking about controlling you.   
                 Always start by asking what a person means when they say  
               this phrase, then shut up and see. Often, people who think  
               of themselves as being anti gun unwittingly adopt the       
               position that only the rulers should be armed (cop and army 
               guns OK, but not you). Such a person isn't anti gun at all, 
               they're simply anti rights - your rights.

  187          We have to start with a ban on the manufacturing and import 
               of handguns. From there we register the guns which are      
               currently owned, and follow that with additional bans and   
               acquisitions of handguns and rifles with no sporting        
               purpose.

  190          I am convinced that we can do to guns what we've done to

  191          If cowardly and dishonorable men sometimes shoot unarmed men

  197          "...Misguided utopian disarmament advocates love the phrases
               "pro gun" and "anti gun," because they automatically win    
               when they're used. They believe the righteous path is to be 
               anti gun, because only devils would be pro gun. You flat    
               lose if you allow a debate to be framed that way.           
               The debate is really between people who are "pro rights" and
               "anti rights" (and then you automatically win), because the 
               righteous choice between pro rights and anti rights is      
               obvious....A more accurate, and far more compelling term    
               than the common "anti gun." The reverse term, which         
               describes you, is "pro rights." Fight the desire to cast       
               repressionists as "anti gun," (and by so doing casting      
               yourself narrowly as "pro gun"). Instead, always refer more 
               broadly to the "anti-rights" posture they take. Make them

  198          I believe the most popular and significant signature of the 
               gun rights subculture is an ancient challenge issued by King
               Leonidas of Sparta. In 480 B.C., he and 300 of his Spartan  
               warriors occupied the narrow pass at Thermopylae to delay   
               the onslaught of the gigantic Persian army. Historians put  
               the size of the Persian forces between 150,000 and 2 million
               men.                                                        
                                                                          
               When ordered by the Persian commander to give up their      
               weapons, Leonidas shouted back, "Molon labe!" or "Come take 
               them!" The valiant Greeks fought to the last man and bought   
               precious time for their countrymen to prepare.              
                                                                         
               If the leaders of the anti-gun lobby had been aware that    
               Molon labe! is a highly popular rallying cry among their    
               enemies, they might have realized that their plan to force  
               their views on American society was doomed to failure.      
               Unfortunately for them, they were not comfortable monitoring

  200          More broadly appealing and less polarizing than "Second     
               Amendment."...But saying "Bill of Rights" protects you from 
               malicious stigma and stereotyping as a "gun nut." Much more 
               difficult to oppose, slows the bigots down. All the rights  
               count, don't they, and they're all under attack. Bill of    
               Rights Day. Pro Bill of Rights. I support the Bill of       
               Rights, don't you? Actually, even virulent gun haters and   
               gun bigots champion the First Amendment and other parts of  
               the BOR, which, if you'll recall, was a single amendment    
               (with separate articles) to the Constitution.

  201            When the Cambrian measures were forming,                  
               They promised perpetual peace.                              
                 They swore, if we gave Them our weapons,                  
               that the wars of the tribes would cease.                    
                 But when we disarmed They sold us,                        
               and delivered us, bound, to our foe,                        
                 And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said:               
               "Stick to the Devil you know."

  202          They tell us, sir, that we are weak; unable to cope with so 
               formidable an adversary. But when shall we be stronger? Will
               it be the next week, or the next year? Will it be when we   
               are totally disarmed, and when a British guard shall be     
               stationed in every house?

               and "chuck 'em out, the brutes,"                            
               But they're the "Savior of our loved ones"

  204          At what point shall we expect the approach of danger? By    
               what means shall we fortify against it? Shall we expect some
               trans-Atlantic military giant to step the ocean and crush us
               with a blow?  Never!  All the armies of Europe, Asia and    
               Africa combined with a Bonaparte at their head and disposing
               of all the treasure of the earth, our own excepted, could   
               not by force make a track on the Blue Ridge or take a drink 
               from the Ohio in a trial of a thousand years. At what point 
               then is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer, if 
               it ever reach us it must spring up from amongst us. It      
               cannot come from abroad. If destruction be our lot, we      
               ourselves must be its author and finisher. As a nation of   
               free men, we must live through all times, or die by         
               suicide.

  205          There is a move throughout the land,                        
               To take our guns away.                                      
               For some see guns as dangerous,                             
               And evil in our day.                                        
                                                                          
               The wise man knows it is the gun,                           
               Which made our country free,                                
               To even our the power of,                                   
               Both greed and gluttony.                                    
                                                                          
               Respect the gun and in your life,                              
               Your gun will be the tool,                                  
               To guarantee you freedom from,                              
               The mean dictator's rule.                                   
                                                                          
               No gun has ever killed a man,                               
               Or caused him any pain,                                     
               When it was used respectfully,                              
               By someone with a brain.                                    
                                                                          
               But yet we have in Government,                              
               Someone who can not see,
               They can't solve crime by taking guns,
               From folk like you and me.

               For guns don't cause the problem,
               Which makes the crime rate soar,
               It's the criminal mind behind it,
               So rotten to the core.

  207          I have a very strict gun control policy: if there's a gun   
               around, I want to be in control of it.

  208          Gun control is hitting what you aim at.                     

                                                                             



   
  209          The New York Times editorial page is like a Ouija board that
               has only three answers, no matter what the question. The    
               answers are: higher taxes, more restrictions on political   
               speech and stricter gun control.
