<h2><font face="Arial" color="#808080">Gun Control</font></h2>

<hr>

<P>
<b><font face="Arial" size="2">
SUMMARY</font></b><P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
Congress continues to debate the efficacy 
and constitutionality of federal regulation of 
firearms and ammunition. Various federal 
laws have been enacted since 1934 to promote 
such regulation.&nbsp;</font><P>
<font face="Arial" size="2"> Gun control advocates argue 
that they curb access by criminals, juveniles, 
and other "high-risk" individuals. They 
contend that only federal measures can successfully 
reduce the availability of guns. 
Some seek broad policy changes such as 
near-prohibition of non-police handgun ownership 
or the registration of all firearm owners 
or firearms. They assert that there is no constitutional 
barrier to such measures and no 
significant social costs. Others advocate less 
comprehensive policies that they maintain 
would not impede ownership and legitimate 
firearm transfers.&nbsp;</font><P>
<font face="Arial" size="2"> Opposition to federal controls 
is strong. Gun control opponents deny 
that federal policies keep firearms out of the 
hands of high-risk persons; rather, they argue, 
controls often create burdens for law-abiding 
citizens and infringe upon constitutional rights 
provided by the Second Amendment. Some 
argue further that widespread gun ownership 
is one of the best deterrents to crime as well as 
to potential tyranny, whether by gangs or by 
government. They may also criticize the 
notion of enhancing federal, as opposed to 
state, police powers.&nbsp;</font><P>
<font face="Arial" size="2"> The two most significant 
federal statutes controlling firearms in the 
civilian population are the National Firearms 
Act of 1934 and the Gun Control Act of 
1968. The 1934 Act established strict registration 
requirements and a transfer tax on 
machine guns and short-barreled long guns. 
The 1968 Act prohibits mail-order sales and 
the interstate sales of firearms, prohibits 
transfers to minors, limits access to "new" 
assault weapons, and sets forth penalties and 
licensing requirements for manufacturers, 
importers, and dealers.&nbsp;</font><P>
<font face="Arial" size="2"> Crime and mortality 
statistics are often used in the gun control 
debate. The number of homicides committed 
annually with a firearm by persons in the 14-
to 24-year-old age group increased by 173% 
from 1985 to 1993, and then decreased by 
47% from 1993 to 1999. Firearm fatalities 
from all causes and for all age groups 
decreased by 22%. For juveniles, they de-creased 
by 40%, from 1993 to 1998.&nbsp;</font><P>
<font face="Arial" size="2"> The 
106 th Congress considered several measures to 
regulate firearms. They included 1) requiring 
background checks at gun shows, 2) requiring 
firearm safety locks, and 3) increasing controls 
on assault weapons and handguns. None, 
however, were enacted. Several dozen gun 
control-related proposals have been introduced 
in the 107 th Congress. One measure has 
been approved by committee: this bill (H. R. 
4757) would require that a greater number of 
federal and state records that are pertinent to 
determining firearms transfer and possession 
eligibility be made accessible through the 
National Criminal Instant Background Check 
System (NICS). NICS performance emerged 
as an issue during consideration of proposals 
that would require background checks for 
firearm transfers by nonlicensed persons at 
gun shows. Such proposals were considered 
in the 106 th Congress but have not been reconsidered 
in the 107 th Congress to date. A discharge 
petition on another measure was narrowly 
defeated by the House: this bill (H. R. 
218) would exempt certain qualified current 
and former law enforcement officers from 
state laws prohibiting concealed carry of 
firearms.</font><P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<B>BACKGROUND AND ANALYSIS&nbsp; 
</B></font><P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<B> 
Pro/ Con Debate 
</B>Through the years, legislative proposals to restrict the availability of firearms to the 
public have raised the following questions: What restrictions on firearms are permissible 
under the Constitution? Does gun control constitute crime control? Can the nation's rates 
of homicide, robbery, and assault be reduced by the stricter regulation of firearm commerce 
or ownership? Would restrictions stop attacks on public figures or thwart deranged persons 
and terrorists? Would household, street corner, and schoolyard disputes be less lethal if 
firearms were more difficult and expensive to acquire? Would more restrictive gun control 
policies have the unintended effect of impairing citizens' means of self-defense?</font>
<P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
In recent years, proponents of gun control legislation have often held that only <I>federal 
</I>laws can be effective in the United States. Otherwise, they say, states with few restrictions 
will continue to be sources of guns that flow illegally into restrictive states. They believe 
that the Second Amendment to the Constitution, which states that "A well regulated Militia, 
being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms 
shall not be infringed," (1) is obsolete; or (2) is intended solely to guard against suppression 
of state militias by the central government and therefore restricted in scope by that intent; or 
(3) does not guarantee a right that is absolute, but one that can be limited by reasonable 
requirements. They ask why a private citizen needs any firearm that is not designed 
primarily for hunting or other recognized sporting purposes.</font> 
<P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
Proponents of firearm restrictions have advocated policy changes on specific types of 
firearms or components that appear to be useful primarily for criminal purposes or that pose 
unusual risks to the public. Fully automatic firearms (i. e., machine guns) and short-barreled 
rifles and shotguns have been subject to strict regulation since 1934. Fully automatic 
firearms have been banned from private possession since 1986, except for those legally 
owned and registered with the Secretary of the Treasury on May 19, 1986. More recently, 
"Saturday night specials" (loosely defined as inexpensive, small handguns), "assault 
weapons," ammunition feeding devices with capacities for more than seven rounds, and 
certain ammunition have been the focus of control efforts.&nbsp;</font>
<P>
 
<font face="Arial" size="2">
 
Opponents of gun control vary in their positions with respect to specific forms of 
control but generally hold that gun control laws do not accomplish what is intended. They 
argue that it is as difficult to keep weapons from being acquired by "high risk" individuals, 
even under federal laws and enforcement, as it was to stop the sale and use of liquor during 
Prohibition. In their view, a more stringent federal firearm regulatory system would only 
create problems for law-abiding citizens, bring mounting frustration and escalation of bans 
by gun regulators, and possibly threaten citizens' civil rights or safety. Some argue that the 
low violent crime rates of other countries have nothing to do with gun control, maintaining 
instead that multiple cultural differences are responsible.</font> 
<P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
Gun control opponents also reject the assumption that the only legitimate purpose of 
ownership by a private citizen is recreational (i. e., hunting and target-shooting). They insist 
on the continuing need of people for effective means to defend person and property, and they 
point to studies that they believe show that gun possession lowers the incidence of crime. 
They say that the law enforcement and criminal justice system in the United States has not 
demonstrated the ability to furnish an adequate measure of public safety. Some opponents 
believe further that the Second Amendment includes a right to keep arms as a defense against 
potential government tyranny, pointing to examples in other countries of the use of firearm 
restrictions to curb dissent and secure illegitimate government power.</font> 
<P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
The debate has been intense. To gun control advocates, the opposition is out of touch 
with the times, misinterprets the Second Amendment, or is lacking in concern for the 
problems of crime and violence. To gun control opponents, advocates are naive in their faith 
in the power of regulation to solve social problems, bent on disarming the American citizen 
for ideological or social reasons, or moved by irrational hostility to firearms and gun 
enthusiasts.</font> 
<P>

<B>Gun-Related Statistics&nbsp; </B></font> 
<P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<B> 
Number of Guns. </B>The National Institute of Justice (NIJ) reported in a national survey that in 1994, 44 million people, approximately 35% of households, owned 192 
million firearms, 65 million of which were handguns. Seventy-four percent of those 
individuals were reported to own more than one firearm. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, 
and Firearms (ATF) estimates that as of the end of 1996, approximately 242 million firearms 
were available for sale to or were possessed by civilians in the United States. That total 
includes roughly 72 million handguns (mostly pistols, revolvers, and derringers), 76 million 
rifles, and 64 million shotguns.</font> 
<P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
Most guns available for sale are produced domestically. In recent years, one to two 
million handguns were manufactured each year, along with one million rifles and less than 
one million shotguns. Annual imports are considerably fewer  from 200,000 to 400,000 
handguns, 200,000 rifles, and 100,000 to 200,000 shotguns. Retail prices of guns vary 
widely, from $50 or less for inexpensive, low-caliber handguns to more than $1,500 for 
high-quality rifles or shotguns. Data are not available on the number of "assault weapons" 
in private possession or available for sale, but estimates prepared in 1989 by a firearms 
expert associated with the Smithsonian Institution placed the number of such firearms at that 
time in the range of one to four million, less than 3% of the number of guns estimated to 
exist in the civilian market.&nbsp;</font>
<P>
 
<B><font face="Arial" size="2">Criminal Use. </font> </B><font face="Arial" size="2">Reports submitted by state and local law enforcement agencies to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and published annually in the <I>Uniform Crime Reports 
</I>indicate that both the crime rate and the violent crime rate have declined since 1981. Of the 
homicides in which the type of weapon could be identified, from 60% to almost 70% have 
involved firearms each year. The number of homicides and the proportion involving firearms 
have declined in recent years. In 2000 of the 12,943 homicides reported, 66% (8,493) were 
committed with firearms. Of those committed with firearms, 79% (6,686) involved 
handguns. From 1993 to1999, the number of firearm-related homicides decreased by an 
average rate of nearly 11% annually, for an overall decrease of 49%. In 2000, firearm-related 
homicides increased slightly (by 13 homicides) to 8,493.</font> 
<P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
The other principal source of national crime data is the <I>National Crime Victimization 
Survey </I>(NCVS) conducted by the Bureau of the Census and published by the Bureau of 
Justice Statistics. The NCVS database provides some information on the weapons used by 
offenders, based on victims' reports. Based on data provided by survey respondents in 
calendar year 1999, BJS estimated that, nationwide, there were 6.3 million violent crimes 
(rape or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault). Weapons were used 
in about 1.6 million of these criminal incidents. Firearms were used by offenders in about 
533,000 of these incidents, or roughly 8%. For further information, see <I>Criminal 
Victimization 2000: Changes 1999-2000 with Trends 1993-2000, </I>by Callie Marie Rennison 
[http:// www. ojp. usdoj. gov/ bjs/ pub/ pdf/ cv00. pdf].</font> 
<P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<B>Gun Violence and Youth. </B>Youth crime statistics have often been used in the gun control debate. The number of homicides committed annually with a firearm by persons in 
the 14-to 24-year-old age group increased sharply from 1985 to 1993; they have declined 
since then, but not to the 1985 level. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, from 
1985 to 1993, the number of firearm-related homicides committed by 14-to 17-year-olds 
increased by 294%, from 855 to 3,371. From 1993 to 1999, the number of firearm-related 
homicides committed by persons in this age group decreased by 65%, from 3,371 to 1,165.</font> 
<P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
From 1985 to 1993, firearm-related homicides committed by 18-to 24-year-olds 
increased by 142%, from 3,374 to 8,171. From 1993 to 1999, firearm-related homicides 
committed by persons in this age group decreased by 43%, from 8,717 to 4,973. For further 
information, see <I>Homicide Trends in the United States, </I>by James Alan Fox, at 
[http:// www. ojp. usdoj. gov/ bjs/ homicide/ homtrnd. htm].</font> 
<P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
Although gun-related violence in schools is statistically a rare event, a Department of 
Justice survey indicated that 12.7% of students age 12 to 19 reported knowing a student who 
brought a firearm to school. For further information, see CRS Report RL30482, <I>The Safe 
and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Program: Background and Context, </I>by Edith 
Fairman Cooper.</font> 
<P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<B>Suicides, Accidents, and Other Deaths. </B>Firearm fatalities have decreased continuously since 1993. The source of national data on firearm deaths is the publication 
<I>Vital Statistics, </I>published each year by the National Center for Health Statistics. Firearm 
deaths reported by coroners in each state are presented in four categories: homicides and 
legal intervention, suicides, accidents, and unknown circumstances. In 1999, a total of 
28,874 firearm deaths occurred, according to such reports. Of this total, 11,127 were 
homicides or due to legal intervention; 16,599 were suicides; 824 were unintentional
(accidental) shootings; and 324 were of unknown cause. From 1993 to 1998, firearm-related 
deaths decreased by an average rate of 5% annually, for an overall decrease of 27%. Also 
in 1999, there were 1,776 juvenile (under 18 years of age) deaths attributed to firearms. Of 
the juvenile total, 1,010 were homicides or due to legal intervention; 558 were suicides; 158 
were unintentional; and 50 were of unknown cause. From 1993 to 1999, firearm-related 
deaths for juveniles have decreased by an average rate of 10% annually, for an overall 
decrease of 46%.</font> 
<P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<B>Self-defense. </B>According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, NCVS data from 1987 to 1992 indicate that in each of those years, roughly 62,200 victims of violent crime (1% of 
all victims of such crimes) used guns to defend themselves. Another 20,000 persons each 
year used guns to protect property. Persons in the business of self-protection (police officers, 
armed security guards) may have been included in the survey. Another source of information 
on the use of firearms for self-defense is the "National Self Defense Survey" conducted by 
criminology professor Gary Kleck of Florida State University in the spring of 1993. Citing 
responses from 4,978 households, Dr. Kleck estimated that handguns have been used 2.1 
million times per year for self-defense, and that all types of guns have been used 
approximately 2.5 million times a year for that purpose, during the 1988-1993 period.</font> 
<P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
Why do these numbers vary? Law enforcement agencies do not collect information on 
the number of times civilians use firearms to defend themselves or their property against 
attack. Such data have been collected in household surveys. The contradictory nature of the 
available statistics may be partially explained by methodological factors. That is, these and 
other criminal justice statistics reflect what is <I>reported </I>to have occurred, not necessarily the 
actual number of times certain events occur. Victims and offenders are sometimes reluctant 
to be candid with researchers. So, the number of criminal incidents can only be estimated, 
making it difficult to state with certainty the accuracy of statistics such as the number of 
times firearms are used in self-defense. For this and other reasons, criminal justice statistics 
often vary when different methodologies are applied.</font> 
<P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
Survey research can be limited, since it is difficult to produce statistically significant 
findings from small incident populations. For example, the sample in the National Self-Defense 
Survey might have been too small, given the low incidence rate and the inherent 
limitations of survey research.</font> 
<P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<B>Recreation. </B>According to the National Institute of Justice (NIJ), in 1994 recreation was the most common motivation for owning a firearm. There were approximately 15 
million hunters, about 35% of gun owners, in the United States and about the same number 
and percentage of gun owners engaged in sport shooting in 1994. The U. S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service reported that 31.6 million persons purchased hunting licenses or permits in 1993 and, 
according to the National Sporting Goods Association, in that year approximately 18.5 
million persons took part in firearms sporting activities.&nbsp;</font>
<P>
 
<B><font face="Arial" size="2">Federal Regulation of Firearms </font> 
</B><font face="Arial" size="2">As stated in the Gun Control Act of 1968, as amended (P. L. 90-618; Title 18, <I>United 
States Code, </I>Chapter 44), the purpose of federal firearm regulation is to assist federal, state, 
and local law enforcement in the ongoing effort to reduce crime and violence. In the same 
act, however, Congress also stated that the intent of the law is not to place any undue or 
unnecessary burdens on law-abiding citizens in regard to the lawful acquisition, possession, 
or use of firearms for hunting, trapshooting, target shooting, personal protection, or any other 
lawful activity.</font> 
<P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
Indeed, issues related to federal firearm regulation currently under debate generally 
revolve around the following questions. One, who should be ineligible to possess firearms? 
Two, what types of firearms are appropriate for statutorily enumerated lawful firearm 
activities? Three, when, where, and how is it appropriate to check persons seeking to acquire 
a firearm for possession eligibility?</font> 
<P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<B>Federal Regulation of Firearm Transfers. </B>Under current law, federal firearm licensees (hereafter referred to as licensees) may ship, transport, and receive firearms that 
have moved in interstate and foreign commerce. Licensees are currently required to verify 
with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) through a background check that nonlicensed 
persons are eligible to possess a firearm before subsequently transferring a firearm to them. 
Licensees must also verify the identity of nonlicensed transferees by inspecting a 
government-issued identity document, <I>e. g., </I>a driver's license.</font> 
<P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
Under current law, there are 9 classes of persons prohibited from possessing firearms: 
1) persons convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term 
exceeding 1 year; 2) fugitives from justice; 3) drug users, or addicts; 4) persons adjudicated 
mental defectives, or committed to mental institutions; 5) unauthorized immigrants; 6) 
persons dishonorably discharged from the Armed Forces; 7) U. S. citizenship
renunciates; 8) 
persons under court-order restraints related to harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate 
partner or child of such intimate partner; and 9) persons convicted of misdemeanor domestic 
violence (18 U. S. C. § 922( g)).</font> 
<P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
Licensees may engage in interstate transfers of firearms between themselves without 
conducting background checks. While they may transfer long guns (rifles or shotguns) to 
out-of-state residents, as long as there are in-person meetings and such transfers would not 
knowingly be in violation of the laws of the state in which the nonlicensed transferees reside, 
they may not transfer handguns to unlicensed out-of-state residents. Transfer of handguns 
by licensees to anyone under 21-years-of-age is prohibited, as is the transfer of long guns to 
anyone under 18-years-of-age (18 U. S. C. § 922( b)). Also, licensees are required to submit 
a "multiple sales reports" to the Secretary of the Treasury if any person purchases two or 
more handguns within 5 business days.</font> 
<P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
Furthermore, licensees are required to maintain records on all acquisitions and 
dispositions of firearms. They are obligated to respond to Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms (ATF) agents requesting firearm tracing information within 24 hours. Under 
certain circumstances, ATF agents may inspect, without search warrants, their business 
premises, inventory, and records.&nbsp;</font>
<P>
 
<font face="Arial" size="2">
 
On the other hand, nonlicensees are prohibited from acquiring firearms from out-of-state 
sources (except for long guns acquired from licensees under the scenario described 
above). Nonlicensees are also prohibited from transferring firearms to any persons who they 
have reasonable cause to believe are not residents of the state in which the transaction occurs. 
In addition, since 1986, it has been a federal offense for nonlicensees to knowingly transfer 
a firearm to prohibited persons. It is also notable that firearm transfers initiated through the 
Internet are subject to the same federal laws as transfers initiated in any other manner. (For 
further information, see CRS Report RS20957, <I>Internet Firearm Sales, </I>by T. J.
Halstead.)</font> 
<P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
Finally, since 1994, it has been a federal offense for any nonlicensed person to transfer 
a handgun to anyone under 18-years-of-age. It has also been illegal for anyone under the 
under 18 years-of-age to possess a handgun (there are exceptions to this law related to 
employment, ranching, farming, target practice, and hunting) (18 U. S. C. § 922( x)).</font> 
<P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<B>Brady Act Implementation. </B>According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, since the implementation of the Brady Act on February 29, 1994, through calender year
(CY) 2000, 
nearly 30 million firearm background checks were completed, resulting in 689,000 denials 
(an overall 2.3% denial rate). During the interim period of the Brady Act (phase I), from 
February 1994 through November 1998, there was a waiting period of up to 5 days for 
handgun transfers in states without instant check systems. Nearly 13 million firearm 
background checks were completed, resulting in 312,000 denials.</font> 
<P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
Phase II and the permanent provisions of the Brady Act became effective on November 
30, 1998. As part of phase II, the Federal Bureau of Investigation rolled out the National 
Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). Through NICS, and under the 
permanent Brady provisions, background checks are conducted of applicants for both hand 
and long gun transfers. In 26 states, state agencies serve as points of contact
(POCs) and 
conduct background checks for handgun transfers. In 16 states, state agencies serve as POCs 
and conduct background checks for both long gun and handgun transfers. In POC states, 
federal firearm licensees contact the state agency, and the state agency contacts the FBI. In
non-POC states, federal firearm licensees contact the FBI directly through the NICS system.</font> 
<P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
During the first 25 months of NICS operation (through December 31, 2000), the FBI 
completed over 17 million background checks for firearm transfer applications. Of this 
number, 639,000 background checks resulted in firearm transfers being denied. Roughly half 
of these background checks were submitted by federal firearm licensees, and the other half 
by state agencies (POCs). The overall number of firearm transfer applications and required 
background checks declined by 11% from 8.6 million in CY1999 to 7.7 million in CY2000. 
Of total checks in FY2000, 2.0% (153,000) resulted in denials. Over 59% of denials 
occurred because the applicant was a felon or was under felony indictment, as compared to 
72% in FY1999. The next most common reason for denial, about 12% of cases in FY2000, 
was a domestic violence misdemeanor conviction or restraining order. For further 
information on phase II, see <I>Background Checks for Firearm Transfers, 2000 </I>(Washington, 
July 2001), at [http:// www. ojp. usdoj. gov/ bjs/ abstract/ bcft00. htm].</font>

<font face="Arial" size="2">
According to GAO, about 75% of the NICS checks handled by the FBI resulted in 
immediate determinations of eligibility. Of the remaining 25% that resulted in a non-definitive 
response, neither a "proceed" nor a denial, 80% were turned around within 2 hours. 
The remaining 20% of delayed transactions took hours or days for the FBI NICS examiners
to reach a final determination. In many cases these sales were delayed because there was an 
outstanding charge without a final disposition against the person seeking to purchase the 
firearm. Such cases necessitate that the FBI examiners contact local or state authorities for 
additional information. Under current law, the FBI is authorized to delay the sale for 3 
business days in order to determine the outcome of the charge and, thus, establish the 
eligibility of the transferee to possess a firearm.</font> 
<P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
NICS system availability --how regularly the system can be accessed during business 
hours and not delay legitimate firearm transfers --has also been a source of complaint. GAO 
found, however, that in the first year of NICS operation, the FBI had achieved its system 
availability goal of 98% for 4 months. System availability for the remaining 8 months 
averaged 95.4%. For further information, see GAO Report GGD/ AIMD-00-64, <I>Gun 
Control: Implementation of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System 
</I>(Washington, February 2000).</font> 
<P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
For state agencies, background checks may not be as expeditious. Background checks 
through state agencies, however, may be more thorough, since state agencies may have 
greater access to databases and records that are not available through NICS. For further 
information, see <I>National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS): Operations 
Report (November 30 1998 -December 31, 1999) </I>(Washington, revised August 1, 1999), at

<B>Federal Firearm Prosecutions. </B>Regarding enforcement of the Brady Act, from November 1998 through June 2000, the FBI referred 134,522 Brady-related cases to the
ATF, and 37,926 of these cases were referred to ATF field offices for investigation. 
According to ATF, in FY2000 there were 1,485 defendants charged with firearm-related 
violations as a result of NICS checks under Brady. Of these defendants, 1,157 were charged 
with providing falsified information to federal firearm licensees (18 U. S. C. § 922( a)( 6)), 
another 86 were persons ineligible to posses firearms under the domestic violence gun ban 
(18 U. S. C. §§ 922( g)( 8) and (9)), and 136 were convicted felons (18 U. S. C. § 922( g)( 1)).</font> 
<P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, however, federal firearm prosecutions 
decreased by 19% from 1992 to 1996, they leveled off through 1997, and increased in 1998 
and 1999. The decline in federal prosecutions can be attributed in part to a Supreme Court 
decision (Bailey <I>v. United States </I>(516 U. S. 137, 116 S. Ct. 501)) that limited the use of the 
charge of using a firearm during a violent or drug-related offense (18 <I>United States Code, </I>§ 
924( c)). See <I>Federal Firearm Offenders, 1992-98 (with Preliminary Data for 1999)

<font face="Arial" size="2">
<B>Major Federal Firearm Statutes. </B>Two major federal statutes regulate the commerce in firearms, or their ownership: the National Firearms Act of 1934 (26 U. S. C. § 
5801 <I>et seq.) </I>and the Gun Control Act of 1968, as amended (18 U. S. C. Ch. 44, § 921 <I>et seq.). 
</I>The National Firearms Act was originally designed to make it difficult to obtain types 
of firearms perceived to be especially lethal or to be the chosen weapons of "gangsters," most 
notably machine guns and short-barreled long guns. This law also regulates firearms, other 
than pistols or revolvers, that can be concealed on a person (e. g., pen, cane, and belt buckle 
guns). It taxes all aspects of the manufacture and distribution of such weapons. And, it
compels the disclosure (through registration with the Secretary of the Treasury) of the 
production and distribution system from manufacturer to buyer.</font> 
<P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
The Gun Control Act of 1968, as amended, contains the principal federal restrictions 
on domestic commerce in small arms and ammunition. The statute requires all persons 
manufacturing, importing, or selling firearms <I>as a business </I>to be federally licensed; prohibits 
the interstate mail-order sale of all firearms; prohibits interstate sale of handguns generally, 
sets forth categories of persons to whom firearms or ammunition may not be sold (such as 
persons under a specified age or with criminal records); authorizes the Secretary of the 
Treasury to prohibit the importation of non-sporting firearms; requires that dealers maintain 
records of all commercial gun sales; and establishes special penalties for the use of a firearm 
in the perpetration of a federal drug trafficking offense or crime of violence. Transactions 
between persons "not engaged in the business" are not covered by the Act. These 
transactions and other matters such as possession, registration, and the issuing of licenses to 
the owners of firearms maybe covered by state laws or local ordinances. It also prohibits 
federal firearm licensees from selling or delivering a rifle or shotgun to a person under 18 
years of age, or a handgun to a person under 21 years of age.</font> 
<P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
Supplementing federal law, many state firearm laws are stricter than federal law. For 
example, some states require permits to obtain firearms and impose a waiting period for 
firearm transfers. Other states are less restrictive, but state law cannot preempt federal law. 
Federal law serves as the minimum standard in the United States.</font> 
<P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
The following principal changes have been enacted to the Gun Control Act since 1968.&nbsp;</font>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2"> The "Firearms Owners Protection Act,"
    McClure-Volkmer Amendments 
(P. L. 99-308, 1986) eases certain interstate transfer and shipment 
requirements for long guns, defines the term "engaged in the business," 
eliminates some record-keeping requirements, and bans the private 
possession of machine guns not legally owned prior to 1986.&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
The "Armor Piercing Ammunition" Ban (P. L. 99-408, 1986, amended in 
P. L. 103-322, 1994) prohibits the manufacture, importation and delivery of 
handgun ammunition composed of certain metal substances and certain full-jacketed 
ammunition.&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
The Federal Energy Management Improvement Act of 1988 (P. L. 100-615) 
requires that all toys or firearm look-alikes have a blazed orange plug in the 
barrel, denoting that it is a non-lethal imitation.&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
The Undetectable Firearms Act (P. L. 100-649, 1988), also known as the 
"plastic gun" legislation, bans the manufacture, import, possession, and 
transfer of firearms not detectable by security devices.&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
The Gun-Free School Zone Act of 1990 (P. L. 101-647), as originally 
enacted, was ruled unconstitutional by the U. S. Supreme Court (United 
<I>States v. Lopez, </I>514 U. S. 549 (1995), April 26, 1995). The Act prohibited 
possession of a firearm in a school zone (on the campus of a public or 
private school or within 1,000 feet of the grounds). In response to the 
Court's finding that the Act exceeded Congress's authority to regulate 
commerce, the 104 th Congress included a provision in P. L. 104-208 that 
amended the Act to require federal prosecutors to include evidence that the 
firearms "moved in" or affected interstate commerce.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2"> The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, 1993 (P. L. 103-159) requires 
that background checks be completed on all nonlicensed person seeking to 
obtain firearms from federal firearm licensees.&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (P. L. 103-322) 
prohibits the manufacture or importation of semiautomatic assault weapons 
and large capacity ammunition feeding devices (for a 10-year period). In the 
case of large capacity ammunition feeding devices, the ban on importation 
applies to those devices manufactured after September 1994. This Act 
provides an exception for the transfer, sale, or possession of semiautomatic 
assault weapons and large capacity ammunition feeding devices lawfully 
possessed on the date of enactment. This Act also bans the sale or transfer 
of handguns and handgun ammunition to, or possession of handguns and 
handgun ammunition by, juveniles (under 18 years of age) without prior 
written consent from the juvenile's parent or legal guardian; exceptions 
related to employment, ranching, farming, target practice, and hunting are 
provided. In addition, the Act disqualifies persons under court orders related 
to domestic abuse from receiving a firearm from any person or possessing a 
firearm. It also enhances penalties for the criminal use of firearms and makes 
other changes to existing law.&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
Federal Domestic Violence Gun Ban (the Lautenberg Amendment, in the 
Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY1997, P. L. 104-208) 
prohibits persons convicted of misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence 
from possessing firearms and ammunition. The ban applies regardless of 
when the offense was adjudicated: prior to, or following enactment. It has 
been challenged in the federal courts, but these challenges have been 
defeated. (See CRS Report RL31143, <I>Firearms Prohibitions and Domestic 
Violence Convictions: The Lautenberg Amendment, </I>by T. J. Halstead.)&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
The Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Appropriations Act, 1999 (P. L. 
105-277), requires all federal firearm licensees to offer for sale gun storage 
and safety devices. It also bans firearm transfers to, or possession by, 
nonimmigrants who have overstayed their the terms of their temporary visa.&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
The Treasury, Postal and General Government Appropriations Act (P. L. 106-
58) requires that background checks be conducted when former firearm 
owners seek to redeem a firearm that they sold to a pawnshop.</font></li>
</ul>
<P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<B>Possible Issues for the 107 th Congress 
</B>Several dozen gun control-related proposals have been introduced in the 107 th Congress. 
One of these measures has been approved by committee: this bill (H. R. 4757) would require 
that a greater number of federal and state records that are pertinent to determining firearms 
transfer and possession eligibility be made accessible through the National Criminal Instant 
Background Check System (NICS). NICS performance and robustness emerged as an issue 
during consideration of proposals that would require background checks for firearm transfers 
by nonlicensed persons at gun shows. Such proposals were considered in the 106 th Congress 
but have not been reconsidered in the 107 th Congress to date. In addition, a discharge petition 
on another measure was narrowly defeated by the House: this bill (H. R. 218) would exempt 
certain qualified current and former law enforcement officers from state laws prohibiting 
concealed carry of firearms.&nbsp;</font>
<P>
 
<B><font face="Arial" size="2">Gun Shows. </font> </B><font face="Arial" size="2">Federal law does not regulate gun shows specifically. Federal law regulating firearms transfers, however, is applicable to such transfers at gun shows. Federal 
firearm licensees  those licensed by the federal government to manufacture, import, or deal 
in firearms  are required to conduct background checks on non licensed persons seeking to 
obtain a firearm from them, by purchase or exchange. Conversely, non licensed persons  
those persons who transfer firearms, but who do not meet the statutory test of being "engaged 
in the business"  are not required to conduct such checks. To some, this may appear to be 
an incongruity in the law. Why should licensees be required to conduct background checks 
at gun shows, and not non licensees? To others, opposed to further federal regulation of 
firearms, it may appear to be a continuance of the status quo, <I>i. e., </I>non-interference by the 
federal government into private firearm transfers within state lines. On the other hand, those 
seeking to increase federal regulation of firearms may view the absence of background checks 
for firearm transfers between non licensed/ private persons as a loophole in the law that needs 
to be closed. At issue for Congress is whether federal regulation of firearms should be 
expanded to include private firearm transfers at gun shows and other similar venues.</font> 
<P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
It is currently unclear what the Bush Administration's position will be on gun shows and 
NICS checks. During the presidential candidate debates, then candidate, now President, 
George W. Bush stated that he favored extending background checks to all firearm transfers 
at gun shows. More recently, President Bush stated that he supported such checks if they 
could be completed within 24 hours. Among gun show-related bills introduced in the 107 th 
Congress, there are basically two legislative proposals. The first, which passed the Senate in 
the 106 th Congress, is known by its sponsor in the 106 th Congress, former Senator Frank
Lautenberg. Proposals modeled on the Lautenberg language have been included in the 
following bills introduced in the 107 th Congress: S. 16, S. 767, S. 940, H. R. 1990, and H. R. 
4034. The last bill (H. R. 4034) was introduced by the ranking member of the Judiciary 
Committee, Representative John Conyers. The second proposal, introduced as S. 890, is 
known by its sponsors in the 107 th Congress, Senators John McCain and Joseph
Lieberman. 
This second proposal has also been introduced in the House as H. R. 2377 by Representative 
Michael Castle. Both proposals address several questions.</font> 
<P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
! How would the term "gun show" be defined? The Lautenberg proposal 
defines a gun show as any event at which 50 or more firearms are offered for 
sale or transfer and there are not less than 10 vendors. Instead of gun show, 
the McCain/ Lieberman proposal uses the term "special firearms event," 
defining it as any event at which 75 or more firearms are offered for sale or 
transfer. ! 
Should gun show promoters/ special firearms event operators be required to 
register with the Secretary of the Treasury? Both bills would require 
promoters/ operators to register with the Secretary of the Treasury. Unlike the 
Lautenberg proposal, the McCain/ Lieberman proposal would also require 
frequent operators who organize two or more of these events in a 6-month 
period to be licensed, and it would require both frequent and infrequent 
operators to submit ledgers of nonlicensed vendors before and after each 
event to the Secretary of the Treasury. ! 
Should all firearms transactions at gun shows be conducted by federal firearm 
licensees, or should a special licensee be responsible for conducting NICS 
checks for nonlicensees? The Lautenberg proposal adopts the former 
approach, the McCain/ Lieberman, the latter. Also, the McCain/ Lieberman proposal would prohibit special licensees from displaying firearms for sale 
or transfer at events where they are designated to conduct background checks 
for nonlicensees. ! 
How many days should the FBI be given to complete background checks at 
gun shows? The Lautenberg proposal does not address this issue, leaving in 
place the current statutory 3 business day delayed sale. In contrast, the McCain/ Lieberman proposal would establish a certification process by which 
states could opt for a maximum 24-hour delayed sale, when 95% of the 
state's disqualifying records (criminal and otherwise) going back 30 years are 
made available online.</font>

<P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<B>Project Exile. </B>Both gun control supporters and opponents are likely to call for greater enforcement of existing federal gun control statutes. Many maintain that "Project Exile" is 
a useful model upon which to build increased federal gun prosecutions. An initiative mounted 
by the U. S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, "Project Exile" was a concerted 
effort to coordinate federal, state, and local law enforcement efforts to reduce gun violence 
in Richmond, Virginia. At that time, Richmond had the second highest homicide rate for 
cities with populations of 100,000 or more. Of those homicides, 80% were committed with 
a firearm. As part of Project Exile, the U. S. Attorneys reviewed cases that involved felons, 
drug users/ traffickers, domestic violence and firearms, and these cases were singled out for 
prosecution in federal court. A felon caught carrying a firearm while trafficking in drugs was 
very likely to be sentenced to 5 years in a federal prison (18 U. S. C. § 924( c)). From 1997 to 
1998, the number of homicides in Richmond dropped by 31%, and this decrease has been 
attributed to Project Exile. U. S. Attorneys in other major metropolitan areas have adopted this 
approach.</font> 
<P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
In the 106 th Congress, the House passed the Project Exile: The Safe Streets and 
Neighborhoods Act of 2000 (H. R. 4051). This bill would have amended the Violent Crime 
Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (P. L. 103-322) to create a program to provide 
firearms sentencing incentive grants to encourage states to adopt programs that would be 
similar to Project Exile. <I>For similar legislation introduced in the 107 th Congress, see H. R. 
534, S. 16, and S. 619. 
</I></font><P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<B>Background Check Record Retention and Fees. </B>Attorney General John Ashcroft recently announced that National Instant Background Check System
(NICS) records 
on approved sales would be destroyed after 24 hours retention. He maintains that to keep 
these records longer was a violation of federal law. Previously, the Department of Justice 
published a rule that would reduce from 6 to 3 months the length of time that the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation would retain such information on approved sales (see 64 <I>Fed. Reg. 
</I>10263-10265, March 3, 1999). The National Rifle Association (NRA) had challenged the 
DOJ rule to retain the records on approved sales for 6 months in federal court. On July 11, 
2000, however, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, in the case 
of <I>NRA v. Reno </I>(No. 99-5270, 216 F. 3d 122; 2000 U. S. App. Lexis 15906), found that 
nothing in the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act prohibits the temporary retention of 
information about lawful firearm transfers.&nbsp; According to GAO, next-day destruction of records may not adversely affect routine 
NICS audits to determine the accuracy of eligibility decisions made by NICS examiners, if 
such audits are done on an hourly or daily basis. However, next-day destruction of records 
may adversely affect non-routine audits, such as when a law enforcement agency requests 
information about a firearm transfer that NICS records show was allowed, but subsequent 
information shows that the transferee was ineligible to receive a firearm. For further 
information, see GAO Report GAO-02-653, <I>Gun Control: Potential Effects of Next-Day 
Destruction of NICS Background Check Records </I>(Washington: July 2002).</font>
<P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
In regard to fees, the FY2002 Commerce-Justice-State appropriations act (P. L. 107-77) 
includes a provision that prohibits user fees being charged for background checks under the 
Brady Handgun Prevention Act.</font> 
<P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<B>Federal and State Background Check Records. </B>The House Judiciary Committee amended and approved a bill to improve the National Instant Background Check System
(NICS) on July 23, 2002. This bill, "Our Lady of Peace Act" (H. R. 4757), was introduced by 
Representative Carolyn McCarthy. Among other things, this bill would: (1) amend the Brady 
Handgun Violence Prevention Act to require federal agencies to provide, and the Attorney 
General to secure, any government records with information relevant to determining the 
eligibility of a person to receive a firearm for inclusion in NICS; (2) require states to make 
available to the Attorney General certain records that would disqualify persons from acquiring 
a firearm, particularly those records that relate to convictions for misdemeanor crimes of 
domestic violence and persons adjudicated as mental defective; and (3) authorize 
appropriations for grant programs to assist states, courts, and local governments in 
establishing or improving such automated record systems.</font> 
<P>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<B>Concealed Carry. </B>Several bills introduced in the 107 th Congress would exempt certain qualified current and former law enforcement officers from state laws prohibiting 
concealed carry of firearms (H. R. 218, H. R. 255, H. R. 382, S. 442, and S. 2480). The most 
recent bill (S. 2480) was introduced by Senator Patrick Leahy  the Chair of the Senate 
Judiciary Committee, and Senator Orrin Hatch  the committee's ranking minority member, 
at the request of the Fraternal Order of Police. The Senate bill is nearly identical to a measure 
(H. R. 218) introduced by Representative Randy Cunningham. A discharge petition on H. R. 
218, which would have required House consideration of this bill, was narrowly defeated on 
November 13, 2001. Concealed carry of firearms has traditionally been a matter of state law. 
In states that allow concealed carry, there are two types of laws: "may issue" and "shall issue." 
States with discretionary, or "may issue," laws leave the decision to issue or deny permits with 
the issuing authority (usually the state police). States with non-discretionary, or "shall issue," 
laws require that permits be issued to applicants who meet certain criteria.</font><!-- SiteSearch Google -->
