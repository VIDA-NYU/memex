<P><b>What are the latest developments in the U.S. gun control controversy?</b></P>

<P>The gun control controversy has resurfaced in the aftermath of two recent indiscriminate deadly shootings involving automatic weapons.  In July 2012 a crazed gunman opened fire in a crowded Colorado movie theatre, killing 12.  An even more horrific incident occurred in December 2012 when a mentally ill young man attacked a school in Connecticut, killing 26 people including 20 kindergarten children.  In the wake of these incidents there has been a renewed call for an assault weapon ban and restricting access of mentally ill persons to such weaponry.
  </P>

<P>It remains to be seen whether renewed gun control fervor will continue since gun control has not been a politically popular issue in recent years. Fewer Americans are supportive of gun control in general  <A  
HREF="gc-pubopina.html"><IMG SRC="barchart.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=10 ALT=""></A>&nbsp;and handgun control in particular.   <a href="gc-pubopin.html"><IMG SRC="barchart.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=10 ALT=""></A>&nbsp;&nbsp; While the issue has dropped in overall public concern, it remains what politicians consider a "wedge issue" as many opponents of gun control are passionate about their right to unfettered gun ownership and may make voting decisions on this issue alone.  The percentage of  
Americans who consider "gun control" as an important issue has been low until it again rose in the aftermath of these shootings..     






<P><B>What is the present level of gun control in the United States?</P>
</B><P>Like many other aspects of public policy, gun control is a matter of federal, state and even local legislation.  There are constitutional limits to gun control as a 2008 Supreme Court decisions determined that the 2nd Amendment protects gun ownership.  The ruling does not prevent reasonable efforts at  
gun control but it does prohibit the kind of outright ban of handguns that has existed in Washington D.C.. </P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Federal Gun Control</b>

<P>The first major gun control initiative was enacted by Congress in 1934 which regulated the sale of fully automatic firearms like machine guns.  This  
legislation was followed in 1938 by a  new federal law which required gun sellers to be licensed and which prohibited persons convicted of violent felonies  
from purchasing guns.  No further legislation was passed by Congress until 1968.  The Gun Control Act of 1968 regulated imported guns, expanded gun-dealer  
licensing requirements, and expanded the list of persons not eligible to purchase guns to include persons convicted of any non-business related felony,  
minors, persons found to be mentally incompetent, and users of illegal drugs.   In 1986, federal legislation established mandatory penalties for the use of a  
gun in the commission of a federal crime.  Also prohibited were "cop killer" bullets capable of penetrating bulletproof clothing.  In 1990, legislation was  
passed which banned the manufacturing and importation of semi-automatic assault weapons.</P>
<P>In 1994, Congress passed what has been regarded as the most comprehensive effort at national gun control.  The "Brady Bill" named for the press aide who  
was seriously injured in the assassination attempt on President Reagan imposed a five day waiting period for purchasers of handguns and required local law  
enforcement authorities to conduct background checks of all purchasers.  The Supreme Court held that the background check provision was unconstitutional  
because it infringed on state's rights.  Presently, the law has been revised so that the background check is instantly accomplished by gun dealers through a  
national computer system and there is no longer a waiting period.  Also in 1994, Congress passed a ban on certain types of assault weapons.   This ban  
expired in 2004.   By a narrow margin <a href="gc-assaultsen.html"><IMG SRC="barchart.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=10 ALT=""></A>, the Senate voted to  
extend the ban but the House did not take action and the ban was allowed to expire.  Efforts to revive the ban have been unsuccessful.  </P></LI></UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>State and local gun control


</B><P>Guns are additionally regulated by state and local legislation and there is little uniformity among the states. 
 <a href="gc-stateglaw.html"><IMG  
SRC="usmap.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=28 HEIGHT=14></A><Font Size="1">&nbsp;(Click to see map)</Font><Font Size ="3">  The major regulatory issues are:</P>


<UL>
<LI><B>Child Access Prevention laws

</B><P>Many states have passed legislation making it a crime to leave a loaded weapon within easy access of a minor.<BR><BR></P></LI></UL>



<UL>
<LI><B>Concealed weapon laws

</B><P>About seven states prohibit concealed weapons.  Many others require an individual to show a need prior to obtaining a license to carry a concealed  
weapon.  In over half the states, all non-felons are able to obtain licenses to carry concealed weapons.  Only one state, Vermont, has no licensing or permit  
requirement.<BR><BR></P></LI></UL>


<UL>
<LI><B>Regulation of private sales to minors

</B><P>Under federal law, minors under 18 are prohibited from possessing guns and minor under 21 are prohibited from purchasing guns from dealers.  However,  
unless regulated by state law, minors 18 and over are able to freely purchase weapons through private sales.   Currently 21 states either prohibit or  
substantially regulate this secondary market for minors.<BR><BR></P></LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>Regulating all secondary market sales

</B><P>Over twenty states regulate all secondary sales through registration or licensing requirements.  In the states that have no such regulation, the  
secondary market allows minors and criminals to easily obtain weapons.  This is the so-called "gun show" loophole.<BR><BR></P></LI></UL>



<UL>
<LI><B>Ban on "assault" weapons
</B><P>In 1989, California was the first state to ban certain types of automatic weapons.  More extensive bans have been enacted in New Jersey, Hawaii,  
Connecticut and Maryland.<BR><BR> </P></LI></UL>


<UL>
<LI><B>"One handgun a month" laws

</B><P>Many purchasers (felons and minors) have circumvented federal law by purchasing firearms from individuals who have legally made bulk purchases of  
handguns.  Four states (South Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, and California) have laws that limit legal purchases of handguns to one a month per  
buyer.<BR><BR></P></LI></UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>Ban on "Saturday Night Specials" and other "junk guns"

</B><P>These are small, easily concealed lightweight guns which are unreliable but have appeal to criminals because of their portability.   A minority of  
states have laws which regulate the purchase and use of these weapons.  Additionally, local laws in a number of cities outlaw the possession of these  
weapons.   <BR><BR></P></LI></UL>



<UL>
<LI><B>Preemption  

</B><P>The majority of states have laws which prohibit local authorities from passing local gun control ordinances.   These "preemption" laws have been  
supported by the opponents of gun control.  Officials in cities which are able to pass such ordinances, such as New York, credit their existence to a  
dramatic reduction in violent crime.  <BR><BR></P></LI></UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>Waiting periods
</B><P>Although background checks are no longer necessary under federal law, about half the states still use state data in addition to federal data to  
conduct background checks prior to issuing a handgun permit.  Eleven of these states impose waiting periods as well.</P></LI></UL>
</LI></UL>

<P><B>How many guns are there?</P>
</B><P>According a 1994 Department of Justice survey, about 35% of American households own 192 million firearms of which handguns constituted 35% of the  
total. <a href="gc-gowntype.html"><IMG SRC="piechart.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=18 HEIGHT=12></A> <Font Size="1">&nbsp;(Click to see chart)</Font><Font Size ="3">  
&nbsp;&nbsp; Polling data shows that the actual household ownership rate is higher.   
<a href="gc-ownershippoll.html"><IMG SRC="barchart.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=10 ALT=""></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Gun sales, has evidenced by Brady background check data, have  
significantly increased in 2008 and there are reports that they have increased further in 2009 based on concerns that a Democratic administration and  
Congress would bring in a new era of regulation.  cbs Slightly less than half of gun owners own both handguns and shotguns or rifles.   <a href="gc-gtypown.html"><IMG SRC="piechart.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=18 HEIGHT=12></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;  The typical gun owner is male, middle class, college educated and lives  
in a small town or rural area.   Gun ownership varies greatly by region and there is a significant correlation between the percentage of handgun ownership  
and the rate of gun-related homicide.  <a href="gc-regionowndeath.html"><IMG SRC="usmap.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=25 HEIGHT=14></A> </P>
<A name="3"></A>
<P><B>How effective have gun control efforts been?</P>
</B><P>It is possible that recent gun control legislation has accomplished some of its goals.  Although less than 3% of gun applications have been denied  
since the enactment of the Brady bill, most of the denials have kept guns from felons.  <a href="gc-gundenreas.html"><IMG SRC="piechart.gif" BORDER=0  
WIDTH=18 HEIGHT=12></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;  The total amount deaths due to guns significantly decreased in the 1990's but has the rate of decrease has leveled off  
in this decade.   <a href="gc-gundthinj.html"><IMG SRC="barchart.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=10></A><Font Size="1">&nbsp;</Font><Font Size ="3">&nbsp;   
&nbsp;Handgun use is the overwhelming cause of such injuries and fatalities. <a href="gc-gunused.html"><IMG SRC="piechart.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=18  
HEIGHT=12></A>&nbsp; &nbsp;Because most gun injuries and deaths result from criminal assault and homicide <a href="gc-guninjcause.html"><IMG  
SRC="piechart.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=18 HEIGHT=12></A>, part of the decrease is certainly due to the overall decrease in the crime rate. The domestic production of handguns decreased in the early years of the 21st century but it has again increased. <a href="gc-gunproduc.html"><IMG SRC="barchart.gif"  
BORDER=0 WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=10></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;   
The number of approved Brady background checks also indicates a steady rate of firearm ownership. <a href="gc-bradyrate.html"><IMG SRC="barchart.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=10  
ALT=""></A> </P>
<P>But gun control activists still believe that it is far to easy for criminals to obtain guns and that an alarming proportion of the population remains  
armed.  Their concern has been fueled by an unprecedented recent rash of school shootings and fatalities.   Many experts are blaming this phenomena on  
violent video games and poor parenting but in each case the youths involved had easy access to the weapons that they used.   Gun control advocates support  
measures which would require trigger locks on all guns and which would apply the provisions of the Brady bill to gun shows.  Gun control advocate groups also  
advocate a federal law authorizing only one handgun purchase per month and raising the age for gun ownership from 18 to 21.</P></P>
<P>On the other hand, opposition to gun control led by the National Rifle Association (NRA) remains fierce and passionate.   These gun owners maintain that  
an unregulated right to bear arms is guaranteed to citizens by the 2nd amendment and this position received support in a Supreme Court decision issued in  
2008 which disallowed a Washington D.C. complete ban on handguns.  Opponents of gun control argue that gun owners often use their weapons to deter crime and  
that handguns are most commonly used for this purpose.   Some studies have shown that such defensive use of weapons occurs at a much greater rate than the  
extent to which weapons are used in criminal activity although the validity of these studies is in dispute.   Gun control opponents are generally law abiding  
citizens who put greater trust in individualism than in the government to protect their safety.  They are concerned that each step toward greater gun control  
will lead to the eventual confiscation of all firearms.   Gun control opponent groups spend far more than gun control supporters on campaign contributions.   
</P>

<A name="4"></A>
<P><B>How do other countries regulate guns?</P>
</B><P>Almost all major countries have systems for registration of firearms.  Most major countries do permit the ownership of handguns.  Many countries ban  
ownership of certain types of weapons although some have no restrictions.  No country has anywhere near the rate of gun ownership as in the United States and  
there is a correspondingly high gun homicide rate.  But other countries such as Canada have a significant degree of gun ownership yet a low rate of gun  
homicide.  The Mexican gun homicide rate reflects the drug trafficking problem in that country.  Most of the guns involved have been smuggled in from the  
neighboring United States.<a href="gc-intgunsa.html"><IMG SRC="barchart.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=10 ALT=""></A></P>


<P><B>How do Democrats and Republicans differ on gun control?</b></P>

<P>Although Democrats tend to support gun control proposals and Republicans do not, the relative unimportance of the issue to most Americans has resulted in a paucity of successful gun control leglisation at any level in the past decade.  Moreover, the opposition of gun proponents to all forms of gun control has remained fierce.  Gun control opponents raise far more money than do gun control advocates.  <a href="gc-gunlobby.html"><IMG SRC="piechart.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=18 HEIGHT=13></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999 the Senate narrowly voted to regulate gun shows&nbsp;<a href="gc-gunshowvt.html"><IMG SRC="barchart.gif" BORDER=0  
WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=10 ALT=""></A>&nbsp; and more substantially supported a measure for trigger locks <a href="gc-lock99.html"><IMG SRC="barchart.gif" BORDER=0  
WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=10 ALT=""></A>&nbsp; but no action was taken by the House with respect to either proposal.  In April 2004, the Senate again voted for handgun  
locks <a href="gc-handgunlockvt.html"><IMG SRC="barchart.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=10 ALT=""></A>&nbsp;but the House did not consider the measure and the  
issue has not recently been resurrected.  Supporters of gun control measures are instead on the defensive as Congressional votes have increased  
rather than restricted gun rights.  For example, continued Amtrak funding was conditioned on a provision allowing guns to be in checked luggage.  <A
