<p><strong>Each year about 17,500 individuals are brought into the
  United
  States and held against their will as victims of human trafficking.</strong></p>

<br>
<p>Some estimate the number is as high as 60,000 annually. These
numbers do not include those who are here from previous years, migrants
already in the US, runaways, displaced persons, and those from
oppressed/marginalized groups and the poor. <strong>Combating human
trafficking is a daunting task and emergency healthcare providers have
a critical role to play.</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><br>
Medical providers are a frontline of defense for victims -
especially providers in an emergency department setting. Victims
present here, often with their traffickers, and receive medical
attention but not the further help they need to remove them from the
environment that places their lives at risk daily. <strong>Emergency
healthcare providers often miss the signs of human trafficking, mistake
the signs for intimate partner violence, and are rarely aware of how to
help</strong>. Instead victims are sent back "home" with their
traffickers. This situation can change and it must. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><br>
Emergency care providers must identify these victims and provide the
opportunity for appropriate treatment. This website contains
information to give practitioners a basic introduction to what human
trafficking is, the clinical presentation of such patients, and the
unique treatment needs of this patient population. <strong>Click on
the
"Educational Tools" tab for helpful instruments in educating providers
at your institution. Click on the "In the ED" tab if you suspect you
are caring for a trafficked person. </strong></p>

the trafficker demands, regardless of the traffickers actual ability to
follow through with said threat(s), there will be dire (physical,
financial, or other) consequences. Traffickers use a variety of
techniques to control their victims. A hallmark of the criminal
industry is the sophisticated use of psychological and financial
control mechanisms, often minimizing or precluding the need for
physical violence or confinement.<sup>2</sup> </font></p>

often hard to come by in this field. Trafficking is an illegal industry
so finding out just how many victims there are annually is difficult.
Conservative estimates say that 15,000 people are trafficked into the
U.S. annually, while others guess the number is high at 60,000. It is
reasonable to say that whichever number or wherever in between the
truth lay, the number is one too many. Finding local statistics may
also be difficult, but local organizations are better equipped to tell
you how big of a problem trafficking is in your area. Ideally, you need
to know the number of persons trafficked locally, the number of victims
presenting as emergency care patients, and the number of survivors who
escaped because of hospital intervention. Also important to know are
which facilities the referrals are coming from. States with the
greatest concentration of trafficked persons are New York, California,
and Florida; Washington DC also has a large trafficked population. Some
organizations to contact for more info in this, and in all areas
regarding trafficking are:</font><br>

<p align="justify"> </p>
<ul>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This is
an unfortunate but real phenomenon of our communities. It is especially
unfortunate in circumstances like those that surround human trafficking
because the very people who ought to aid trafficked persons cannot
always be counted on to help. Sometimes victims have already had prior negative
experience(s)<sup>7</sup> with law enforcement, which makes them scared
of police and, in general, mistrustful of institutions and people that
are supposed to help. Because some police receive pay-offs from
traffickers to look the other way, providers are not always aware of
who can be trusted in their local police departments. Thusly, providers
should not call the police when they identify a trafficked person; the
help hotlines will know what to do and whom to trust in law
enforcement. Furthermore, providers should assure the patient that the
police will not be called without their permission.</font></p>
</ul>
<ul>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Note
that this does not mean all law enforcement are corrupt, but that those
few have tainted the reputation of the institution and the result is
that trafficked persons, in general, do not trust law enforcement
officials. It takes a great deal of time and effort to rebuild that
trust and local anti-trafficking advocates are qualified to help
rebuild that trust. Law enforcement is receiving training about and in
dealing with human trafficking victims, but because of victims pre- and
sometimes misconceptions about police, hotlines should be called not
police.</font></p>

the patient decides to involve the justice system, but also because if

anything else about trafficking. These types of NGOs are the best

  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Key to
understanding the emergency provider's role in the anti-trafficking
movement and in treating a trafficked patient is understanding that the
emergent issue, which causes the patient to present, is only a symptom
of a disease: human trafficking is the disease. The same way that
victims of intimate partner violence need to be removed from a
dangerous living environment, trafficking victims need to be separated
from their trafficker. Just as providers understand that fatigue,
mental confusion, shortness of breath and pruritis may be symptoms of
kidney disease, we must also acknowledge that cigarette burns, ligature
marks, depression, and malnutrition may be symptoms of human
trafficking. Merely treating the symptoms of kidney disease does not
serve the best interests of the patient, nor does treating the symptoms
of human trafficking but sending the patient back home. Human
trafficking, as a disease, must be considered as a differential when a
patient presents to the ED with certain symptoms.<sup>8</sup></font><br>

There are different kinds of trafficking and these stories only
illustrate three. All three of these people could (or did) present as
trafficking patients in an ED and all of them would demonstrate signs
or symptoms of trafficking; think about who would present in what way(s).</font></p>

<ul>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
    stories of Leighton, Hamid and Veisaga are true and give names to the
    millions that are counted as nameless. Emergency healthcare
    practitioners have a significant role to play in learning the names of
    these people but first providers must be made aware.</font></p>
