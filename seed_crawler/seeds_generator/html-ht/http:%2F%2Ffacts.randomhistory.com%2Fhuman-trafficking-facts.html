<li>Approximately 75-80% of human trafficking is for sex.<sup>a</sup></li>
<li>Researchers note that sex trafficking plays a major role in the spread of HIV.<sup>b</sup></li>
<li>There are more human slaves in the world today than ever before in history.<sup>l</sup></li>
<li>There are an estimated 27 million adults and 13 million children around the
  world who are victims of human trafficking.<sup>l</sup></li>
<li>Human trafficking not only involves sex and labor, but people are also trafficked
  for organ harvesting.<sup>k</sup></li>
<li>Human traffickers often use a Sudanese phrase &ldquo;use a slave to catch
  slaves,&rdquo; meaning traffickers send &ldquo;broken-in girls&rdquo; to recruit
  younger girls into the sex trade. Sex traffickers often train girls themselves,
  raping them and teaching them sex acts.<sup>l</sup></li>
<li>Eighty percent of North Koreans who escape into <a href="http://facts.randomhistory.com/2009/05/04_china.html">China</a> are women. Nine out
  of 10 of those women become victims of human trafficking, often for sex. If
  the women complain, they are deported back to <a href="http://facts.randomhistory.com/facts-about-north-korea.html">North
  Korea</a>, where they are thrown
  into gulags or are executed.<sup>h</sup></li>
    <span style="float: right; width: 160px; padding: 0px 0px 7px 12px; color: #333; text-align: center; font-size: 10px;">
        <img src="http://www.randomhistory.com/photos/2011/human-trafficking.jpg" alt="woman human trafficking" width="158" height="105" border="0" style="border: solid 1px #333; margin-bottom: 4px;">
        Approximately 30,000 victims of sex trafficking die each year
    </span>
  

<li>An estimated 30,000 victims of sex trafficking die each year from abuse, disease,
  torture, and neglect. Eighty percent of those sold into sexual slavery are
  under 24, and some are as young as six years old.<sup>j</sup></li>
<li>Ludwig &ldquo;Tarzan&rdquo; Fainberg, a convicted trafficker, said, &ldquo;You
  can buy a woman for $10,000 and make your money back in a week if she is pretty
  and young. Then everything else is profit.&rdquo;<sup>l</sup></li>
<li>A human trafficker can earn 20 times what he or she paid for a girl. Provided
  the girl was not physically brutalized to the point of ruining her beauty,
  the pimp could sell her again for a greater price because he had trained her
  and broken her spirit, which saves future buyers the hassle. A 2003 study in
  the Netherlands found that, on average, a single sex slave earned her pimp
  at least $250,000 a year.<sup>l</sup></li>
<li>Although human trafficking is often a hidden crime and accurate statistics
  are difficult to obtain, researchers estimate that more than 80% of trafficking
  victims are female. Over 50% of human trafficking victims are children.<sup>l</sup></li>
<li>The end of the Cold War has resulted in the growth of regional conflicts and
  the decline of borders. Many rebel groups turn to human trafficking to fund
  military actions and garner soldiers.<sup>k</sup></li>
<li>According to a 2009 <em>Washington Times</em> article, the Taliban buys children
  as young as seven years old to act as suicide bombers. The price for child
  suicide bombers is between $7,000-$14,000.<sup>n</sup></li>
<li>UNICEF estimates that 300,000 children younger than 18 are currently trafficked
  to serve in armed conflicts worldwide.<sup>n</sup></li>
    <span style="float: right; width: 160px; padding: 0px 0px 7px 12px; color: #333; text-align: center; font-size: 10px;">

        Pregnant women are increasingly being trafficked for their newborns
    </span>
<li>Human traffickers are increasingly trafficking pregnant women for their newborns.
  Babies are sold on the black market, where the profit is divided between the
  traffickers, doctors, lawyers, border officials, and others. The mother is
  usually paid less than what is promised her, citing the cost of travel and
  creating false documents. A mother might receive as little as a few hundred
  dollars for her baby.<sup>k</sup></li>
<li>More than 30% of all trafficking cases in 2007-2008 involved children being
  sold into the sex industry.<sup>o</sup></li>
<li>The Western presence in Kosovo, such as NATO troops and civilians, have fueled
  the rapid growth of sex trafficking and forced prostitution. Amnesty International
  has reported that NATO soldiers, UN police, and Western aid workers &ldquo;operated
  with near impunity in exploiting the victims of the sex traffickers.&rdquo;<sup>g</sup></li>
<li>Lady Gaga&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bad Romance&rdquo; video is about human trafficking.
  In the video, Gaga is trafficked by a Russian bathhouse into sex slavery.<sup>f</sup></li>
<li>Human trafficking is the only area of transnational crime in which women are
  significantly represented&mdash;as victims, as perpetrators, and as activists
  fighting this crime.<sup>a</sup></li>
<li><a href="http://facts.randomhistory.com/2009/01/29_global-warming.html">Global
    warming</a> and severe natural disasters have left millions homeless
  and impoverished, which has created desperate people easily exploited by human
  traffickers.<sup>k</sup></li>
<li>Over 71% of trafficked children show <a href="http://facts.randomhistory.com/2009/07/15_suicide.html">suicidal</a> tendencies.<sup>l</sup></li>
<li>After sex, the most common form of human trafficking is forced labor. Researchers
  argue that as the economic crisis deepens, the number of people trafficked
  for forced labor will increase.<sup>k</sup></li>
<li>Most human trafficking in the United States occurs in New York, California,
  and Florida.<sup>l</sup></li>
<li>According to United Nations Children&rsquo;s Fund (UNICEF), over the past
  30 years, over 30 million children have been sexually exploited through human
  trafficking.<sup>k</sup></li>
<li>Several countries rank high as source countries for human trafficking, including
  Belarus, the Republic of Moldova, the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Albania,
  Bulgaria, Lithuania, Romania, China, Thailand, and Nigeria.<sup>l</sup></li>
<li>Belgium, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Thailand,
  Turkey, and the U.S. are ranked very high as destination countries of trafficked
  victims.<sup>l</sup></li>
<li>Women are trafficked to the U.S. largely to work in the sex industry (including
  strip clubs, peep and touch shows, massage parlors that offer sexual services,
  and prostitution). They are also trafficked to work in sweatshops, domestic
  servitude, and agricultural work.<sup>l</sup></li>
    <span style="float: right; width: 160px; padding: 0px 0px 7px 12px; color: #333; text-align: center; font-size: 10px;">
        <img src="http://www.randomhistory.com/photos/2011/rape.jpg" alt="rape" width="158" height="105" border="0" style="border: solid 1px #333; margin-bottom: 4px;">
        Sex traffickers often use brutal violence to &ldquo;condition&rdquo; their victims
    </span>
<li>Sex traffickers use a variety of ways to &ldquo;condition&rdquo; their victims,
  including subjecting them to starvation, rape, gang rape, physical abuse, beating,
  confinement, threats of violence toward the victim and victim&rsquo;s family,
  forced drug use, and shame.<sup>l</sup></li>
<li>Family members will often sell children and other family members into slavery;
  the younger the victim, the more money the trafficker receives. For example,
  a 10-year-old named Gita was sold into a brothel by her aunt. The now 22-year-old
  recalls that when she refused to work, the older girls held her down and stuck
  a piece of cloth in her mouth so no one would hear her scream as she was raped
  by a customer. She would later contract HIV.<sup>l</sup></li>
<li>Human trafficking is one of the fastest growing criminal enterprises because
  it holds relatively low risk with high profit potential. Criminal organizations
  are increasingly attracted to human trafficking because, unlike drugs, humans
  can be sold repeatedly.<sup>k</sup></li>
<li>Human trafficking is estimated to surpass the drug trade in less than five
  years. Journalist Victor Malarek reports that it is primarily men who
  are driving human trafficking, specifically trafficking for sex.<sup>i</sup></li>
<li>Victims of human trafficking suffer devastating physical and psychological
  harm. However, due to language barriers, lack of knowledge about available
  services, and the frequency with which traffickers move victims, human trafficking
  victims and their perpetrators are difficult to catch.<sup>i</sup></li>
<li>In approximately 54% of human trafficking cases, the recruiter is a stranger,
  and in 46% of the cases, the recruiters know the victim. Fifty-two percent
  of human trafficking recruiters are men, 42% are women, and 6% are both men
  and women.<sup>d</sup></li>
<li>Human trafficking around the globe is estimated to generate a profit of anywhere
  from $9 billion to $31.6 billion. Half of these profits are made in industrialized
  countries.<sup>d</sup></li>
<li>Some human traffickers recruit handicapped young girls, such as those suffering
  from Down Syndrome, into the sex industry.<sup>l</sup></li>
<li>According to the FBI, a large human-trafficking organization in California
  in 2008 not only physically threatened and beat girls as young as 12 to work
  as prostitutes, they also regularly threatened them with witchcraft.<sup>e</sup></li>
<li>Human trafficking is a global phenomenon that is fueled by poverty and gender
  discrimination.<sup>k</sup></li>
<li>Human traffickers often work with corrupt government officials to obtain travel
  documents and seize passports.<sup>i</sup></li>
<li>Women and girls from racial minorities in the U.S. are disproportionately
  recruited by sex traffickers in the U.S.<sup>l</sup></li>
<li>The <em>Sunday Telegraph</em> in the U.K. reports that hundreds of children
  as young as six are brought to the U.K. as slaves each year.<sup>m</sup></li>
    <span style="float: right; width: 160px; padding: 0px 0px 7px 12px; color: #333; text-align: center; font-size: 10px;">
        <img src="http://www.randomhistory.com/photos/2011/tokyo.jpg" alt="japan traffic" width="158" height="105" border="0" style="border: solid 1px #333; margin-bottom: 4px;">
        Japan is a major hub of sex trafficking
    </span>
<li>Japan is considered the largest market for Asian women trafficked for sex.<sup>i</sup></li>
<li>Airports are often used by human traffickers to hold &ldquo;slave auctions,&rdquo; where
  women and children are sold into prostitution.<sup>m</sup></li>
<li>Due to globalization, every continent of the world has been involved in human
  trafficking, including a country as small as Iceland.<sup>k</sup></li>
<li>Many times, if a sex slave is arrested, she is imprisoned while her trafficker
  is able to buy his way out of trouble.<sup>l</sup></li>
<li>Today, slaves are cheaper than they have ever been in history. The population
  explosion has created a great supply of workers, and globalization has created
  people who are vulnerable and easily enslaved.<sup>l</sup></li>
<li>Human trafficking and smuggling are similar but not interchangeable. Smuggling
  is transportation based. Trafficking is exploitation based.<sup>l</sup></li>
<li>Sex traffickers often recruit children because not only are children more
  unsuspecting and vulnerable than adults, but there is also a high market demand
  for young victims. Traffickers target victims on the telephone, on the Internet,
  through friends, at the mall, and in after-school programs.<sup>o</sup></li>
<li>Human trafficking has been reported in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and
  in some U.S. territories.<sup>e</sup></li>
<li>The FBI estimates that over 100,000 children and young women are trafficked
  in America today. They range in age from nine to 19, with the average being
  age 11. Many victims are not just runaways or abandoned, but are from &ldquo;good&rdquo; families
  who are coerced by clever traffickers.<sup>o</sup></li>
<li>Brazil and Thailand are generally considered to have the worst child sex trafficking
  records.<sup>k</sup></li>
<li>The AIDS epidemic in Africa has left many children orphaned, making them especially
  vulnerable to human trafficking.<sup>l</sup></li>
<li>Nearly 7,000 Nepali girls as young as nine years old are sold every year into
  India&rsquo;s red-light district&mdash;or 200,000 in the last decade. Ten thousand
  children between the ages of six and 14 are in Sri Lanka brothels.<sup>j</sup></li>
<li>Human trafficking victims face physical risks, such as drug and alcohol addiction,
  contracting <a href="http://facts.randomhistory.com/2009/09/07_std.html">STDs</a>, sterility, miscarriages, forced abortions, vaginal and anal
  trauma, among others. Psychological effects include developing clinical <a href="http://facts.randomhistory.com/random-facts-about-depression.html">depression</a>,
  personality and dissociative disorders, suicidal tendencies, Post-Traumatic
  Stress Syndrome, and Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome.<sup>l</sup></li>
<li>The largest human trafficking case in recent U.S. history occurred in Hawaii
  in 2010. Global Horizons Manpower, Inc., a labor-recruiting company, bought
  400 immigrants in 2004 from Thailand to work on farms in Hawaii. They were
  lured with false promises of high-paying farm work, but instead their passports
  were taken away and they were held in forced servitude until they were rescued in 2010.<sup>c</sup></li>
<li>According to the U.S. State Department, human trafficking is one of the greatest
  human rights challenges of this century, both in the United States and around
  the world.<sup>l</sup></li>
